
The Gun Control Act provides that any person “who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year” is ineligible for a federal license to ship, transport, or receive any firearm or ammunition in interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(h) (1976). Thus, as the Court points out, “[i]f Kennison was not *123 ‘convicted’ in the first place ... respondent should not be ineligible for licenses on the grounds asserted by the Bureau.” Ante, at 990. Contrary to the conclusion reached by the Court, I do not believe that Kennison was “convicted.” Accordingly, I dissent.
 
I agree with the Court that whether one has been convicted within the meaning of the Gun Control Act is a question of federal, rather than state, law.  Id., at 991. Congress did not, however, expressly define the term “conviction” in the Act. Where Congress has defined the term, the Court recognizes that it has given the term different meanings in different statutes. Id., at 991, n. 6. In the Investment Company Act of 1940, Congress expressly provided that the term “convicted” includes “a verdict, judgment, or plea of guilty, or a finding of guilt on a plea of nolo contendere, if such verdict, judgment, plea, or finding has not been reversed, set aside, or withdrawn, whether or not sentence has been imposed.” 15 U.S.C. § 80a–2(a)(10) (1976). The same definition was used in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. 15 U.S.C. § 80b–2(a)(6) (1976). Congress used a more narrow definition in two sections of the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966, providing that “ ‘[c]onviction’ and ‘convicted’ mean the final judgment on a verdict or finding of guilty, a plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere, and do not include a final judgment which has been expunged by pardon, reversed, set aside, or otherwise rendered nugatory.” 18 U.S.C. § 4251(e) (1976); 28 U.S.C. § 2901(f) (1976). Finally, in the Federal Youth Corrections Act, Congress has provided that the term “ ‘conviction’ means the judgment on a verdict or finding of guilty, a plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere.” 18 U.S.C. § 5006(g) (1976).
 
Thus at the most, Congress has required the entry of a formal judgment as the signpost of a “conviction.” At the least, Congress has required the acceptance of a plea. In this case, we have neither. The Court relies on Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927), and *124 Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), for the proposition that “[i]n some circumstances, we have considered a guilty plea alone enough to constitute a ‘conviction.’ ” **998 Ante, at 991. The Court concludes that in this case “we ... have more,” because the state trial judge “noted” the plea and placed Kennison on probation. Id., at 992. I cannot agree.
 
Even if Kercheval and Boykin would otherwise be relevant to our interpretation of the Gun Control Act, both cases spoke of an accepted guilty plea. Whatever a trial court does when it “notes” a plea, it is less, instead of more, than an acceptance of the plea which is preceded by an examination of the defendant to insure that the plea is voluntary.
 
Where the Iowa Deferred Judgment statute can be used, “[t]he trial court may, upon a plea of guilty [and] [w]ith the consent of the defendant ... defer judgment and place the defendant on probation.” Iowa Code § 789A.1 (Supp.1978) (emphasis added) (current version at Iowa Code § 907.3 (1979 and Supp.1982)). Congress has never before considered such circumstances sufficient for a finding of a “conviction”; there is nothing in the Gun Control Act to infer that Congress has adopted such a standard now. It is likely that at the most Congress intended that a “conviction” be represented by a formal entry of judgment, or at the least an acceptance of a guilty plea. But in either case, such criteria are absent where, following a guilty plea, the Iowa Deferred Judgment statute is invoked.*

The Act provides exemptions from its proscriptions for certain business and commercial crimes, such as antitrust violations, punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, and for nonfirearms and nonexplosives state offenses classified by the State as misdemeanors and punishable by imprisonment for two years or less. 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20). These exemptions are of no relevance here.
2
The court, however, in its discretion, in the case of a first offense, could reduce that punishment. See Iowa Code § 695.3 (1950). Sections 695.2 and .3 were repealed effective Jan. 1, 1978, and are now replaced by Iowa Code §§ 724.4 and 903.1 (1979 and Supp.1982).

Section 789A.1 then read in pertinent part:
“The trial court may, upon a plea of guilty, verdict of guilty, or a special verdict upon which a judgment of conviction may be rendered, exercise either of the options contained in subsections 1 and 2. However, this section shall not apply to the crimes of treason, murder, or violation of [other specified statutes].
“1. With the consent of the defendant, the court may defer judgment and place the defendant on probation upon such terms and conditions as it may require. Upon fulfillment of the terms of probation the defendant shall be discharged without entry of judgment. Upon violation of the terms, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
“However, this subsection shall not be available if any of the following is true:
“.... [here are recited specific exceptions to the availability of the procedure outlined in subsection 1]
“2. By record entry at time of or after sentencing, the court may suspend the sentence and place the defendant on probation upon such terms and conditions as it may require.
“Before exercising either of the options contained in subsections 1 and 2, the court shall first determine which of them will provide maximum opportunity for the rehabilitation of the defendant and protection of the community from further offenses by the defendant and others. In making this determination the court shall consider the age of the defendant, his prior record of convictions, if any, his employment circumstances, his family circumstances, the nature of the offense committed, whether a dangerous weapon or force was used in the commission of such offense, and such other factors as shall be appropriate. The court shall file a specific written statement of its reasons for and the facts supporting its decision to defer judgment or to suspend sentence and its decision on the length of probation.”
Section 789A.1 was enacted by 1973 Iowa Acts, ch. 295, § 1. It was repealed by 1976 Iowa Acts, ch. 1245, § 526, effective Jan. 1, 1978. The current replacement statutes are Iowa Code §§ 907.3, .4, and .5 (1979 and Supp.1982).

Section 789A.6 then read in pertinent part:
“At any time that the court determines that the purposes of probation have been fulfilled, the court may order the discharge of any person from probation. ... A person who has been discharged from probation shall no longer be held to answer for his offense. Upon discharge from probation, if judgment has been deferred under section 789A.1, the court's criminal record with reference to the deferred judgment shall be expunged. The record maintained by the supreme court administrator required by section 789A.1 shall not be expunged....”
Section 789A.6 was also enacted in 1973 and was repealed, effective Jan. 1, 1978, by the same Iowa statutes cited in the last paragraph of n. 3, supra. The current statute replacing § 789A.6 is Iowa Code § 907.9 (1979).

See United States v. Bergeman, 592 F.2d 533 (CA9 1979); United States v. Mostad, 485 F.2d 199 (CA8 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 947, 94 S.Ct. 1468, 39 L.Ed.2d 563 (1974); United States v. Lehmann, 613 F.2d 130 (CA5 1980). See also, e.g., United States v. Padia, 584 F.2d 85 (CA5 1978); United States v. Gray, 692 F.2d 352 (CA5 1982); United States v. Nord, 586 F.2d 1288 (CA8 1978); United States v. Kelly, 519 F.2d 794 (CA8), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 926, 96 S.Ct. 272, 46 L.Ed.2d 254 (1975).

To be sure, the terms “convicted” or “conviction” do not have the same meaning in every federal statute. In some statutes those terms specifically are made to apply to one whose guilty plea has been accepted whether or not a final judgment has been entered. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. §§ 80a–2(10) and 80b–2(6). In other federal statutes, however, the term “convicted” is clearly limited to persons against whom a formal judgment has been entered. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 4251(e) and 28 U.S.C. § 2901(f).
The term “convicted” in §§ 922(g) and (h) is not there defined, but we have no reason whatsoever to suppose that Congress meant that term to apply only to one against whom a formal judgment has been entered. Congress' intent in enacting §§ 922(g) and (h) and § 1202 was to keep firearms out of the hands of presumptively risky people. See United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 345, 92 S.Ct. 515, 521, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971). In this connection, it is significant that §§ 922(g) and (h) apply not only to a person convicted of a disqualifying offense but also to one who is merely under indictment for such a crime.

As noted in n. 6, supra, the meaning of the terms “convicted” and “conviction” vary from statute to statute. In Lott v. United States, 367 U.S. 421, 81 S.Ct. 1563, 6 L.Ed.2d 940 (1961), for example, the Court had under consideration Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 34 and a plea of nolo contendere, rather than a plea of guilty. The question was whether the time within which certain motions could be made began to run at the time the nolo plea was entered or at the time judgment was pronounced and sentence imposed. The Court spoke of the possibility of the plea's being withdrawn before sentence was imposed and therefore said that “it is the judgment of the court—not the plea—that constitutes the ‘determination of guilt.’ ” In construing Rule 34, of course, the Court had before it no evidence of a congressional intent to rule broadly to protect the public comparable to that animating Title IV. Moreover, in Lott the Court did not deal with the situation where probation is imposed on the basis of the plea. Under the Iowa expunction statute, one who has pleaded guilty is treated identically to one who has been found guilty by a jury. See n. 3, supra. There is no suggestion in the Iowa statutes, and respondent has not suggested, that once the plea was noted and probation imposed Kennison could withdraw his plea. Indeed, it was a negotiated plea accompanied by the dismissal of the kidnaping charge.

Counsel acknowledged that during the period of Kennison's probation, respondent was disqualified for a license. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36–37.

For purposes of Iowa's own gun control statute, Iowa Code § 724.26 (1979), it might be argued that the conviction was nullified. See State v. Walton, 311 N.W.2d 110, 112 (Iowa 1981). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court of Iowa has observed that the “word ‘conviction’ is of equivocal meaning, and its use in a statute presents a question of legislative intent.” State v. Hanna, 179 N.W.2d 503, 507 (1970). Presumably, therefore, if the Supreme Court of Iowa were called upon to construe the term “convicted” in a statute like §§ 922(g) and (h), that court would look to “legislative intent.”
In any event, Iowa's law is not federal law, and it does not control our decision here. We therefore look to federal considerations in resolving the present case.

Title VII, which we construed in Lewis, explicitly provides that pardons granted by the President of the United States or a state governor, specifying that the recipient is authorized to receive, possess, or transport firearms, lift the disabilities imposed by that title. 18 U.S.C.App. § 1203(2). Except § 925(c), permitting the Secretary to remove the disabilities in specified circumstances, there is no comparable provision in Title IV. By regulation, the Secretary has given presidential pardons, but not gubernatorial pardons, automatic enabling effect under Title IV. 27 CFR § 178.142 (1982).
