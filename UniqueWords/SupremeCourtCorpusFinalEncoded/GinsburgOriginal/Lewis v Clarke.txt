Justice Ginsburg, concurring in the judgment.

 [**643]  On the scope of tribal immunity from suit, I adhere to the dissenting views expressed in Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U. S. 751, 760, 118 S. Ct. 1700, 140 L. Ed. 2d 981 (1998) (Stevens, J., dissenting), and Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U. S. ___, ___, 134 S. Ct. 2024, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1071, 1099 (2014) (Thomas, J., dissenting). See also id., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 2024, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1071, 1110 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). These dissenting opinions explain why tribes, interacting with nontribal members outside reservation boundaries, should be subject to nondiscriminatory state laws of general application. I agree with the  [*1296]  Court, however, that a voluntary indemnity undertaking does not convert a suit against a tribal employee, in the employee’s individual capacity, into a suit against the tribe. I therefore concur in the Court’s judgment.
