DELLMUTH, ACTING SECRETARY OF EDUCATION OF PENNSYLVANIA v. MUTH ET AL.

No. 87-1855

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

491 U.S. 223

February 28, 1989, Argued 
June 15, 1989, Decided

JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
While I join Justice Brennan's dissent, I adhere to my view that a "statute cannot amend the Constitution." Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., ante, at 24  [***198]  (concurring opinion). Because this case deals with the judicially created doctrine of sovereign immunity rather than the real Eleventh Amendment's limitation on federal judicial power, the congressional decision to confer jurisdiction on the federal courts must prevail.
