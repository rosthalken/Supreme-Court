While I fully agree with the views expressed by Justice Ginsburg, post, at 235, 159 L. Ed. 2d, at 350 (2004), and Justice Breyer, post, at 237, 159 L. Ed. 2d, at 351 (dissenting opinions), I am persuaded that the judgment entered by the Court--remanding to the Ninth Circuit to determine the propriety of equitable tolling--is both consistent with those views and correct. I therefore concur in that judgment.
