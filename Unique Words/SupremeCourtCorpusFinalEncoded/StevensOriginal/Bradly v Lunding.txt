Supreme Court of the United States

February 17, 1976, Decided

No. A-695 (75-1146).

 [*1309]   [***75]   [**891]  MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, Circuit Justice.

On February 13, 1976, appellants filed an application for a stay of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois entered on January 19, 1976, reversing an order entered by the Circuit Court for the Seventh Judicial Circuit, Sangamon County, Ill., on January 12, 1976, enjoining the defendant officers of the Illinois State Board of Election Commissioners from conducting a lottery for the purpose of assigning [****2]  ballot positions in accordance with Regulation  [**892]  1975-2 adopted by the State Board of Elections on November 21, 1975.

HN1 Regulation 1975-2 prescribes a lottery system for breaking ties resulting from the simultaneous filing of petitions for nomination to elective office. 1Link to the text of the note Appellants  [*1310]  are independent candidates for judicial office who argue that the regulation increases the probability that their names will appeal in the bottom portion of the ballot rather than in the middle portion, and therefore that their federal constitutional rights are impaired. 2Link to the text of the note This consequence flows from  [***76]  the fact that candidates filing a group petition for the same office are treated as one for lottery purposes.

 [****3]  As I understand the regulation, it also increases the  [*1311]  probability that each of the appellant's names will appear in the top portion of the ballot rather than the middle portion. Thus, the adverse effect of increasing the probability of an especially unfavorable position is offset by the beneficial effect of increasing the probability of an especially favorable position. 3Link to the text of the note Although there may be undesirable consequences of a regulation which permits organization candidates to be grouped in sequence on the ballot, I do not understand the Jurisdictional Statement to present any question as to the propriety of that feature, in and of itself, of the regulation. The questions presented relate only to the impact of the regulation on the ballot positions of the individual appellants. 4Link to the text of the note With respect to that matter, I find insufficient indication of unfairness  [**893]  of irreparable injury to warrant the issuance of a stay against enforcement of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois. Presumably because the questions presented are capable of repetition, appellants  [*1312]  do not suggest that there is any danger that the election will moot the case; accordingly, the stay need [****4]  not issue to protect our jurisdiction.

 [****5]  The motion for stay is denied.
