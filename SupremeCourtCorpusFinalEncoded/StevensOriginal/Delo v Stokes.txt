DELO, SUPERINTENDENT, POTOSI CORRECTIONAL CENTER v. STOKES

No. A-795

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

495 U.S. 320

May 11, 1990, Decided

JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.
In my opinion both the District Court and the Court of Appeals -- particularly when acting en banc -- are in a far better position than this Court to determine whether a successive petition for habeas corpus constitutes an abuse of the writ. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the Court's summary disposition of the application to vacate the stay entered by the District Court and upheld by the Court of Appeals.
