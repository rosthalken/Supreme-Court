
I write separately to note that I continue to believe that disparate-impact claims are not cognizable under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. See **2408 Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228, 247–268, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005) (O’Connor, J., joined by KENNEDY and THOMAS, JJ., concurring in judgment). Moreover, I disagree with the Court’s statement that the “reasonable factors other than age” (RFOA) exception, § 623(f)(1), is principally relevant in disparate-impact cases. Compare City of Jackson, supra, at 251–253, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (opinion concurring in judgment), with ante, at 2402 – 2403 (citing City of Jackson, supra, at 239, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (plurality opinion)). I therefore join only Parts I and II–A of the Court’s opinion because I agree that the RFOA exception is an affirmative defense—when it arises in disparate-treatment cases. Here, although the Court of Appeals erred in placing the burden of proof on petitioners, I would nonetheless affirm because the only claims at issue are disparate-impact claims.
