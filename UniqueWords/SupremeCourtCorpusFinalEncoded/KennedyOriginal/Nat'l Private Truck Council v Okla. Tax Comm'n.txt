JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring.

One reason for difficulty in adapting 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to an action attacking a state tax is, in my view, that § 1983 was not intended for claims based on the Commerce Clause at all. See Dennis v. Higgins, 498 U.S. 439, 451, 112 L. Ed. 2d 969, 111 S. Ct. 865 (1991)  [****19]  (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (violations of the Commerce Clause do not give rise to a cause of action under § 1983); see also Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U.S. 103, 117, 107 L. Ed. 2d 420, 110 S. Ct. 444 (1989) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (a federal statute's pre-emptive effect does not secure a right within the meaning of § 1983). The Court has not adopted that position, however, and on that premise I agree with today's opinion and join it in full.
