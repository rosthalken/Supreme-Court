JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring.

I interpret the last two paragraphs of Part III as deference to a state  [***97]  court's application of the exigent circumstances test to the facts of this case, and not as an endorsement of that particular  [****19]  application of the standard. With that understanding, I join in the opinion of the Court.
