Justice THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.

I agree with the Court that the statements of opinion at issue in this case do not contain an untrue statement of a material fact. 15 U.S.C. § 77k(a); ante, at 1325 – 1327. I write separately because I do not think it advisable to opine, as the majority does, on an additional theory of liability that is not properly before us.
 
The question whether and under what circumstances an omission may make a statement of opinion misleading is one that we should have left to the lower courts to decide on remand. As the majority acknowledges, that question was never passed on below. See ante, at 1332 – 1333. With good reason: Apart from a few conclusory allegations in their complaint and some pro forma references to “misleading statements and omissions” in their briefs, respondents did not elaborate on the omissions theory of liability before either the District Court or the Court of Appeals. They certainly did not articulate the theory the majority now adopts until they filed their merits brief before this Court. And it was not until oral argument that they identified a factual allegation in their complaint that might serve to state a claim under that theory. See ante, at 1332 – 1333. This delay is unsurprising given that, although various Courts of Appeals have discussed the theory, they have been reluctant to commit to it. See MHC Mut. Conversion Fund, L.P. v. Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P., 761 F.3d 1109, 1116 (C.A.10 2014) (“[I]t is difficult to find many [courts] actually holding a security issuer liable on this basis, ... and ... the approach has been questioned by others on various grounds”); see also ibid., n. 5.
 
We should exercise the same caution. This Court rarely prides itself on being a pioneer of novel legal claims, as “[o]urs is a court of final review and not first view.” *1338 Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. ––––, ––––, 132 S.Ct. 1421, 1430, 182 L.Ed.2d 423 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, as a general rule, “we do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). This includes fashioning innovative theories of liability as much as it includes applying those theories to the circumstances of the case.
 
The Court has previously relied on a lower court’s failure to address an issue below as a reason for declining to address it here, even when the question was fairly presented in the petition and fully vetted by other lower courts. See, e.g., CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue, 562 U.S. 277, 284, n. 5, 131 S.Ct. 1101, 179 L.Ed.2d 37 (2011); see also id., at 303, n. 3, 131 S.Ct. 1101 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Surely the feature that distinguishes this case—a novel legal theory that is not fairly included in the question presented—counsels more strongly in favor of avoidance.
 
As Justice SCALIA’s concurrence reveals, the scope of this theory of liability is far from certain. And the highly fact-intensive nature of the omissions theory provides an additional reason not to address it at this time. The majority acknowledges that the facts a reasonable investor may infer from a statement of opinion depend on the context. And yet it opines about certain facts an investor may infer from an issuer’s legal compliance opinion: that such an opinion is based on legal advice, for example, or that it is not contradicted by the Federal Government. See ante, at 1328 – 1329. These inferences may seem sensible enough in a vacuum, but lower courts would do well to heed the majority’s admonition that every statement of opinion must be considered “in a broader frame,” ante, at 1330, taking into account all the facts of the statement and its context. Would that the majority had waited for the “broader frame” of an actual case before weighing in on the omissions theory.
