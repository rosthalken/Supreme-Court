Supreme Court of the United States
Wayne MINNICK et al., Petitioners,
v.
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS et al.
No. 79–1213.
|
Argued Dec. 2, 1980.
|
Decided June 1, 1981.
 

Justice REHNQUIST, concurring.

If I viewed this judgment of the California Court of Appeal as “final” under 28 U.S.C. § 1257, I would join the dissenting opinion of Justice STEWART. Since I do not so view it, however, I join the opinion of the Court dismissing the writ of certiorari for want of jurisdiction.
