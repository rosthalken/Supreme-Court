Supreme Court of the United States
Bryce N. HARLOW and Alexander P. Butterfield, Petitioners
v.
A. Ernest FITZGERALD.
No. 80–945.
|
Argued Nov. 30, 1981.
|
Decided June 24, 1982.
 

Justice REHNQUIST, concurring.
At such time as a majority of the Court is willing to re-examine our holding in Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978), I shall join in that undertaking with alacrity. But until that time comes, I agree that the Court’s opinion in this case properly disposes of the issues presented, and I therefore join it.
