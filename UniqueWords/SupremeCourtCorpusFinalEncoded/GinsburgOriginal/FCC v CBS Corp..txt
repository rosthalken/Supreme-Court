JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring in the denial of certiorari.

The Court's remand in FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U. S. 239, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 4661 (2012), affords the Commission an opportunity to reconsider its indecency policy in light of technological advances and the Commission's uncertain course since this Court's ruling in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, 98 S. Ct. 3026, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1073 (1978).
