
I join the opinion of the Court except to the extent that it might be read to suggest this Court's endorsement of     the view that one who makes a reasonably diligent effort to record will obtain the protections ordinarily reserved for recorded interests. I would express no opinion on that question, for it is not before us and has not been addressed in brief or in argument or, indeed, in the statute.
