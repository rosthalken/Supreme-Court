JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, dissenting.

While I agree with the Court's conclusion that the second question in the jurisdictional statement is insubstantial, I do not believe a court of law has the power simultaneously to dismiss and to accept jurisdiction of a single appeal from a single judgment, I therefore do not join the Court's order.
