Supreme Court of the United States
Michael BOOS, J. Michael Waller and Bridget Brooker, Petitioners
v.
Marion S. BARRY, Jr., Mayor, District of Columbia, et al.
No. 86-803.
|
Argued Nov. 9, 1987.
|
Decided March 22, 1988.

Chief Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Justices WHITE and BLACKMUN join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

For the reasons stated by Judge Bork in his majority opinion below, I would uphold that portion of § 22-1115 of the District of Columbia Code that prohibits the display of any sign within 500 feet of a foreign embassy if that sign tends to *339 bring that foreign government into “public odium” or “public disrepute.” However, I agree with Justice O’CONNOR that § 22-1115’ s congregation clause is not unconstitutional and that the exemption for labor picketing does not violate the Equal Protection Clause, so I join in Parts III and IV of the majority opinion.
