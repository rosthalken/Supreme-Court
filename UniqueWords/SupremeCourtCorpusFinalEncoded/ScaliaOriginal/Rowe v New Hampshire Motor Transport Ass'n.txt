Supreme Court of the United States
G. Steven ROWE, Attorney General of Maine, Petitioner,
v.
NEW HAMPSHIRE MOTOR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION et al.
No. 06–457.
|
Argued Nov. 28, 2007.
|
Decided Feb. 20, 2008.
 
Justice SCALIA, concurring in part.

I join the opinion of the Court, except those portions (ante, at 994 – 995, 996, and 997) that rely on the reports of committees of one House of Congress to show the intent of that full House and of the other—with regard to propositions that are apparent from the text of the law, unnecessary to the disposition of the case, or both.
