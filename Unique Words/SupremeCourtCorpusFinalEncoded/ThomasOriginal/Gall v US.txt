Argued Oct. 2, 2007.

Decided Dec. 10, 2007.
 

Justice THOMAS, dissenting.

Consistent with my dissenting opinion in Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481, 2007 WL 4292040, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals because the District Court committed statutory error when it departed below the applicable Guidelines range.
