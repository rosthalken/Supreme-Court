Ed. 2d 1, 12 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986)). Batson “provides a three-step process for determining when a strike is discriminatory:

“First, a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race; second, if that showing has been made, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question; and third, in light of the parties’ submissions, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.” Foster, 578 U. S., at ___, 195 L. Ed. 2d 1, 12 (internal quotation marks omitted;    emphasis added).

This case concerns a Louisiana procedural rule that permits the trial court, rather than the prosecutor, to supply a race-neutral reason at Batson’s second step if “the court is satisfied that such reason is apparent from the voir dire examination of the juror.” La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 795(C) (West 2013). Louisiana’s rule, as the Louisiana Supreme Court has itself recognized, does not comply with this Court’s Batson jurisprudence. State v. Elie, 05-1569 (La. 7/10/2006), 936 So. 2d 791, 797 (citing Johnson v. California, 545 U. S. 162, 172, 125 S. Ct. 2410, 162 L. Ed. 2d 129 (2005)). At Batson’s second step, “the trial court [must] demand an explanation from the prosecutor.” Johnson, 545 U. S., at 170, 125 S. Ct. 2410, 162 L. Ed. 2d 129; see id., at 172, 125 S. Ct. 2410, 162 L. Ed. 2d 129 (“The Batson framework is designed to produce actual answers [from a prosecutor] to suspicions and inferences that discrimination may have infected the jury selection process. . . . It does not matter that the prosecutor might have had good reasons; what matters is the real reason [jurors] were stricken.” (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)); id., at 173, 125 S. Ct. 2410, 162 L. Ed. 2d 129 (improper to “rel[y] on judicial speculation     to resolve plausible claims of discrimination”).

The rule allowing judge-supplied reasons, nonetheless, remains operative in Louisiana and was applied in petitioner’s 2012 trial. On remand, the appropriate state court should reconsider petitioner’s argument that    the rule cannot be reconciled with Batson. A Louisiana court, “like any other state or federal court, is bound by this Court’s interpretation of federal law.” James v. Boise, 577 U. S. ___, ___, 136 S. Ct. 685, 193 L. Ed. 2d 694 (2016) (per curiam) (slip op., at 2). See also App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a (Belsome, J., dissenting) (“[T]he United States Supreme Court has made clear . . . that the State is obligated to offer a race-neutral reason. The judge is an arbiter not a participant in the judicial process. Allowing the court to provide race-neutral reasons for the State violates [the Constitution].”).
