TERRY STEWART, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL. v. KARL HINZE LAGRAND

98-1368 (A-706)

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

525 U.S. 1174

February 24, 1999, Decided

Justice Stevens dissenting: Because I am not at all sure that the Court has the authority to vacate an injunction without first granting certiorari, and because I also think the Court's order is not entirely clear, I would grant the motion for clarification.
