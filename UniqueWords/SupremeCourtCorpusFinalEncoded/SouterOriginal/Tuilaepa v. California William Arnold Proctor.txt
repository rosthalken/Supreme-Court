PAUL PALALAUA TUILAEPA, PETITIONER 93-5131 v. CALIFORNIA WILLIAM ARNOLD PROCTOR, PETITIONER 93-5161 v. CALIFORNIA

No. 93-5131

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

114 S. Ct. 2630

March 22, 1994, Argued 
June 30, 1994 * , Decided

JUSTICE SOUTER, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion because it correctly recognizes that factors adequate to perform the function of genuine narrowing, as well as factors that otherwise guide the jury in selecting which defendants receive the death penalty, are not  [*981]  susceptible to mathematical precision; they must depend for their requisite clarity on embodying a "common-sense core of meaning," as Justice White put it in Jurek v. Texas, 428 U.S. 262, 279, 49 L. Ed. 2d 929, 96 S. Ct. 2950 (1976) (concurring opinion). Taking factor (b) to be essentially propositional, as the Court uses the term, ante, at 974-975, I find it is sufficiently clear to pass muster; and I agree with the Court's analysis of factor (i) and the challenged portion of factor (a), neither of which is framed as a proposition.
