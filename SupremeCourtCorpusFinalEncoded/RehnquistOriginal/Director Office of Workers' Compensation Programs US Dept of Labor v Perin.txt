Supreme Court of the United States
DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF WORKERS’ COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, Petitioner
v.
PERINI NORTH RIVER ASSOCIATES et al.
No. 81–897.
|
Argued Oct. 4, 1982.
|
Decided Jan. 11, 1983.
 

Justice REHNQUIST, concurring in the judgment.

At the time of his injury, Churchill was engaged in unloading materials from a supply barge to a cargo barge. This work is very much like the work of longshoremen, who typically load and unload vessels. Therefore Churchill was “engaged in maritime employment” within the meaning of § 2(3) the Act, and was within its coverage. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.
