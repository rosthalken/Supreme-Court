
In my view, the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits successive prosecution, not successive punishment. See Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U.S. 767, 798, 114 S. Ct. 1937, 128 L. Ed. 2d 767 (1994) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Civil forfeiture proceedings of the sort at issue here are not criminal prosecutions, even under the standard of Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 164, 9 L. Ed. 2d 644, 83 S. Ct. 554 (1963), and United States v. Ward, 448 U.S. 242, 248-251, 65 L. Ed. 2d 742, 100 S. Ct. 2636 (1980).
