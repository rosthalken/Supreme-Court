
I join the Court’s opinion in full. I write separately to note that the result here is also required by the plain meaning of the Federal Arbitration Act. In AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. ––––, 131 S.Ct. 1740, 179 L.Ed.2d 742 (2011), I explained that “the FAA requires that an agreement to arbitrate be enforced unless a party successfully challenges the formation of the arbitration agreement, such as by proving fraud or duress.” Id., at ––––, 131 S.Ct., at 1753 (concurring opinion). In this case, Italian Colors makes two arguments to support its conclusion that the arbitration agreement should not be enforced. First, it contends that enforcing the arbitration agreement “would contravene the policies of the antitrust laws.” Ante, at 2309. Second, it contends that a court may “invalidate agreements that prevent *2313 the ‘effective vindication’ of a federal statutory right.” Ante, at 2311. Neither argument “concern[s] whether the contract was properly made,” Concepcion, supra, at ––––, 131 S.Ct., at 1756 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Because Italian Colors has not furnished “grounds ... for the revocation of any contract,” 9 U.S.C. § 2, the arbitration agreement must be enforced. Italian Colors voluntarily entered into a contract containing a bilateral arbitration provision. It cannot now escape its obligations merely because the claim it wishes to bring might be economically infeasible.
