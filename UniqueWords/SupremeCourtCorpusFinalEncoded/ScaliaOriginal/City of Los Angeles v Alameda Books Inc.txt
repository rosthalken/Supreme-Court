Supreme Court of the United States
CITY OF LOS ANGELES, Petitioner,
v.
ALAMEDA BOOKS, INC., et al.
No. 00-799.

Argued Dec. 4, 2001.

Justice SCALIA, concurring.

I join the plurality opinion because I think it represents a correct application of our jurisprudence concerning regulation of the “secondary effects” of pornographic speech. As I have said elsewhere, however, in a case such as this our First Amendment **1739 traditions make “secondary effects” analysis quite unnecessary. The Constitution does not prevent those communities that wish to do so from regulating, or indeed entirely suppressing, the business of pandering *444 sex. See, e.g., Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 310, 120 S.Ct. 1382, 146 L.Ed.2d 265 (2000) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 256-261, 110 S.Ct. 596, 107 L.Ed.2d 603 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).
