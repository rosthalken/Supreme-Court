The question whether 10 U. S. C. § 1034 includes a right to circulate petitions is not an easy one for me. I must confess that I think the plain language of the statute and its sparse legislative history slightly favor the Court's reading that it does not. Nevertheless, I agree with MR. JUSTICE STEWART's     construction    of the statute for two reasons. First, in a doubtful case I believe a statute enacted to remove impediments to the flow of information to Congress should be liberally construed. Second, the potentially far-reaching consequences of deciding the constitutional issue 1Link to the text of the note counsel     avoidance of that issue if the "case can be fairly decided on a statutory ground." 2Link to the text of the note MR. JUSTICE STEWART has surely demonstrated that that test is met here. I therefore respectfully dissent.

For the reasons stated by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, I do not consider the constitutional question foreclosed by the Court's decision in Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828. Nor do I view it as so easy as to justify the novel practice of deciding the constitutional question before addressing the statutory issue. Ante, at 349.

"Our settled practice . . . is to avoid the decision of a constitutional issue if a case can be fairly decided on a statutory ground.

Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 411-412 (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (footnote omitted).
