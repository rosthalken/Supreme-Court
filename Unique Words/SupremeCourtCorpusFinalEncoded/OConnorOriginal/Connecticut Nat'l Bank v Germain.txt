JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE WHITE and JUSTICE BLACKMUN join, concurring in the judgment.

I agree that when Congress enacted 28 U. S. C. § 158(d) as part of the Bankruptcy  [**1151]  Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, Congress probably did not intend to deprive the courts of appeals of their longstanding jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals in bankruptcy cases. But I think we should admit that this construction of the statutes does render § 158(d) largely superfluous, and that we do strive to interpret statutes so as to avoid redundancy. Cf. ante, at 253-254. In this case, I think it far more likely that Congress inadvertently created a redundancy than that Congress intended to withdraw appellate jurisdiction over interlocutory bankruptcy appeals by the roundabout method of reconferring jurisdiction over appeals [****15]  from final bankruptcy orders. I would reverse the judgment below only for this reason.
