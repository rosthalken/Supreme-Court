MARVIN D. HORNE, et al., Petitioners v. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

No. 14-275

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

135 S. Ct. 2419

April 22, 2015, Argued 
June 22, 2015, Decided

Justice Thomas, concurring.
I join the Court’s opinion in full. I write separately to offer an additional observation concerning Justice Breyer’s argument that we should remand the case. The Takings Clause prohibits the government from taking private property except “for public use,” even when it offers “just compensation.” U.S. Const., Amdt. 5. That requirement, as originally understood, imposes a meaningful constraint on the power of the state—“the government may take property only if it actually uses or gives the public a legal right to use the property.” Kelo v. New London, 545 U.S. 469, 521, 125 S. Ct. 2655, 162 L. Ed. 2d 439 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting). It is far from clear that the Raisin Administrative Committee’s conduct meets that standard. It takes the raisins of citizens and, among other things, gives them away or sells them to exporters, foreign importers, and foreign governments. 7 CFR §989.67(b) (2015). To the extent that the Committee is not taking the raisins  [**405]  “for public use,” having the Court of Appeals calculate “just compensation” in this case would be a fruitless exercise.
