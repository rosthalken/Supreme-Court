
In my judgment the record not only supports the conclusion that Gilmore was competent to waive    his right to appeal, but also makes it clear that his access to the courts is entirely unimpeded and therefore a third party has no standing to litigate an Eighth Amendment claim - or indeed any other claim - on his behalf. Without a proper litigant before it, this Court is without power to stay the execution.
