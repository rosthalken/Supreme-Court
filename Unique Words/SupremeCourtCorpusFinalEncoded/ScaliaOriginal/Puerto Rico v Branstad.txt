Supreme Court of the United States
PUERTO RICO, Petitioner,
v.
Terry E. BRANSTAD et al.
No. 85–2116.
|
Argued March 30, 1987.
|
Decided June 23, 1987.
 

Justice SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I concur in the result, and in the portions of the Court’s opinion applying 18 U.S.C. § 3182 and overruling Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 16 L.Ed. 717 (1861), insofar as it interpreted the predecessor of that statute. I note that no party before us has asserted the lack of power of Congress to require extradition from a State to a Territory.
