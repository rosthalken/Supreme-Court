Young, 569 U.S. ––––, ––––, 133 S.Ct. 1709, 1721, 185 L.Ed.2d 758 (2013) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted); accord, e.g., Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U.S. 564, 610–612, 117 S.Ct. 1590, 137 L.Ed.2d 852 (1997) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). For that reason, I would uphold Maryland’s tax scheme.
 
In reaching the contrary conclusion, the Court proves just how far our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence has departed from the actual Commerce Clause. According to the majority, a state income *1812 tax that fails to provide residents with “a full credit against the income taxes that they pay to other States” violates the Commerce Clause. Ante, at 1792. That news would have come as a surprise to those who penned and ratified the Constitution. As this Court observed some time ago, “Income taxes ... were imposed by several of the States at or shortly after the adoption of the Federal Constitution.” Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U.S. 37, 51, 40 S.Ct. 221, 64 L.Ed. 445 (1920).* There is no indication that those early state income tax schemes provided credits for income taxes paid elsewhere. Thus, under the majority’s reasoning, all of those state laws would have contravened the newly ratified Commerce Clause.
 
It seems highly implausible that those who ratified the Commerce Clause understood it to conflict with the income tax laws of their States and nonetheless adopted it without a word of concern. That silence is particularly deafening given the importance of such taxes for raising revenues at the time. See Kinsman, The Income Tax in the Commonwealths of the United States 7, in 4 Publications of the American Economic Assn. (1903) (noting, for example, that “Connecticut from her earliest history had followed the plan of taxing incomes rather than property” and that “[t]he total assessed value of [taxable] incomes in Connecticut in the year 1795 was a little over $300,000” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
 
In other areas of constitutional analysis, we would have considered these laws to be powerful evidence of the original understanding of the Constitution. We have, for example, relied on the practices of the First Congress to guide our interpretation of provisions defining congressional power. See, e.g., Golan v. Holder, 565 U.S. ––––, ––––, 132 S.Ct. 873, 181 L.Ed.2d 835 (2012) (Copyright Clause); McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 401–402, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819) (Necessary and Proper Clause). We have likewise treated “actions taken by the First Congress a[s] presumptively consistent with the Bill of Rights,” Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.S. ––––, ––––, 134 S.Ct. 1811, 1834, 188 L.Ed.2d 835 (2014) (ALITO, J., concurring). See, e.g., id., at –––– – ––––, 134 S.Ct., at 1818–1819 (majority opinion); Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 150–152, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925). And we have looked to founding-era state laws to guide our understanding of the Constitution’s meaning. See, e.g., District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 600–602, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008) (Second Amendment); Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U.S. 318, 337–340, 121 S.Ct. 1536, 149 L.Ed.2d 549 (2001) (Fourth Amendment); Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 482–483, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957) (First Amendment); Kilbourn v. Thompson, *1813  103 U.S. 168, 202–203, 26 L.Ed. 377 (1881) (Speech and Debate Clause); see also Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 396–397, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798) (opinion of Paterson, J.) (Ex Post Facto Clause).
 
Even if one assumed that the negative Commerce Clause existed, I see no reason why it would be subject to a different mode of constitutional interpretation. The majority quibbles that I fail to “sho[w] that the small number of individuals who earned income out of State were taxed twice on that income,” ante, at 1807, but given the deference we owe to the duly enacted laws of a State—particularly those concerning the paradigmatically sovereign activity of taxation—the burden of proof falls on those who would wield the Federal Constitution to foreclose that exercise of sovereign power.
 
I am doubtful that the majority’s application of one of our many negative Commerce Clause tests is correct under our precedents, see ante, at 1809 – 1810 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); post, at 1818 – 1823 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting), but I am certain that the majority’s result is incorrect under our Constitution. As was well said in another area of constitutional law: “[I]f there is any inconsistency between [our] tests and the historic practice ..., the inconsistency calls into question the validity of the test, not the historic practice.” Town of Greece, supra, at ––––, 134 S.Ct., at 1834 (ALITO, J., concurring).
 
I respectfully dissent.

The Court offers no response to this reason for permitting a State to tax its residents' worldwide income, other than to urge that Commerce Clause doctrine ought not favor corporations over individuals. See ante, at 1797 – 1798. I scarcely disagree with that proposition (nor does this opinion suggest otherwise). But I fail to see how it answers, or is even relevant to, my observation that affording residents greater benefits entitles a State to require that they bear a greater tax burden.

The majority dismisses what we said in Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U.S. 252, 109 S.Ct. 582, 102 L.Ed.2d 607 (1989), as “dictum” allegedly “repudiated” by the Court in West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186, 203, 114 S.Ct. 2205, 129 L.Ed.2d 157 (1994). Ante, at 1797 – 1798. That is doubly wrong. In Goldberg, we distinguished the tax struck down in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U.S. 266, 107 S.Ct. 2829, 97 L.Ed.2d 226 (1987) (ATA I ), noting, in particular, that the tax in ATA I fell on “out-of-state[rs]” whereas the tax in Goldberg fell on “the insider who presumably is able to complain about and change the tax through the Illinois political process.” 488 U.S., at 266, 109 S.Ct. 582. Essential to our holding, this rationale cannot be written off as “dictum.” As for West Lynn Creamery, far from “repudiat[ing]” Goldberg, the Court cited Goldberg and reaffirmed its political safeguards rationale, as explained below. See infra this page and 5.

Given the pedigree of this rationale, applying it here would hardly “work a sea change in our Commerce Clause jurisprudence.” Ante, at 1799. See United Haulers Assn., Inc. v. Oneida–Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, 550 U.S. 330, 345, n. 7, 127 S.Ct. 1786, 167 L.Ed.2d 655 (2007); Goldberg, 488 U.S., at 266, 109 S.Ct. 582; Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U.S. 456, 473, n. 17, 101 S.Ct. 715, 66 L.Ed.2d 659 (1981); Raymond Motor Transp., Inc. v. Rice, 434 U.S. 429, 444, n. 18, 98 S.Ct. 787, 54 L.Ed.2d 664 (1978); South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Brothers, Inc., 303 U.S. 177, 187, 58 S.Ct. 510, 82 L.Ed. 734 (1938). Nor would applying the rationale to a net income tax cast “doubt” on the Court's gross receipts precedents, ante, at 1799 – 1800, given the Court's longstanding practice of evaluating income and gross receipt taxes differently, see infra, at 1798 – 1799.

Unlike Maryland's county income tax, these early 20th-century income taxes allowed a deduction for taxes paid to other jurisdictions. Compare App. 18 with 1917 Mo. Laws § 5, pp. 526–527, and 1915 Okla. Sess. Laws § 6, p. 234. The Wynnes have not argued and the majority does not suggest, however, that Maryland could fully cure the asserted defects in its tax “scheme” simply by providing a deduction, in lieu of a tax credit. And I doubt that such a deduction would give the Wynnes much satisfaction: Deducting taxes paid to other States from the Wynnes' $2.67 million taxable net income would reduce their Maryland tax burden by a small fraction of the $25,000 tax credit the majority awards them. See Pet. for Cert. 15; App. to Pet. for Cert. A–56.

Upholding Maryland's facially neutral tax hardly means, as the majority contends, ante, at 1798, that the dormant Commerce Clause places no limits on States' authority to tax residents' worldwide income. There are, for example, no well-established principles of interstate and international taxation permitting the kind of facially discriminatory tax the majority “[i]magine[s]” a State enacting. Ibid. Nor are the political processes noted above an adequate safeguard against such a tax. See supra, at 1814 – 1816.

The majority reads American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 545 U.S. 429, 125 S.Ct. 2419, 162 L.Ed.2d 407 (2005) (ATA II ), in a way so implausible, it must resort to quoting from an amicus brief, rather than from the Court's opinion. According to the majority, this Court did not think the challenged tax failed the internal consistency test in ATA II, it held only that the challengers had failed to make the necessary “empirical showing.” See ante, at 1802 – 1803, n. 7. It is true that the United States made that argument. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in ATA II, O.T. 2004, No. 03–1230, p. 26. But one searches the U.S. Reports in vain for any indication that the Court adopted it. Which is hardly surprising, for one would scarcely think that a test turning on “hypothetically ” assessing a tax's “structure,” ante, at 1802 (emphasis added), would require empirical data. What the Court in fact said in ATA II, is that the tax's internal inconsistency would be excused because any multiple taxation resulting from every State adopting the challenged tax would be caused by interstate firms' choosing to “engag[e] in local business in all those States.” 545 U.S., at 438, 125 S.Ct. 2419.

The majority faults the dissents for not “disput[ing]” its “economic analysis,” but beyond citation to a pair of amicus briefs, its opinion offers no analysis to dispute. Ante, at 1803 – 1804.
8
Or Maryland could provide nonresidents a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions on Maryland source income. Cf. ante, at 1805 – 1806.

I do not “clai[m]” as the Court groundlessly suggests, that the Court's analysis “establish[es] ... [a] rule of priority” between residence- and source-based taxation. Ante, at 1805 – 1806. My objection, rather, is that the Court treats source-based authority as “box [ing] in” a State's discrete authority to tax on the basis of residence. Supra, at 1813. There is no “inconsisten[cy]” in my analysis, and the majority plainly errs in insisting that there is. Ante, at 1805 – 1806.
10
Attempting to preserve the test's qualification as a “cure,” the Court redefines the illness as not just double taxation but double taxation caused by an “inherently discriminat[ory]” tax “scheme.” Ante, at 1801 – 1802. Relying on such a distinction to justify the test is entirely circular, however, as the Court defines “inherent discrimination” in this case as internal inconsistency. In any event, given the concern that purportedly drives the Court's analysis, it is mystifying why the Court sees “virtue” in striking down only one of the two schemes under which Bob is taxed twice. Ante, at 1802. Whatever disincentive the original scheme creates for Bob (or the Wynnes) to work in interstate commerce is created just as much by the revised scheme that the Court finds satisfactory.
