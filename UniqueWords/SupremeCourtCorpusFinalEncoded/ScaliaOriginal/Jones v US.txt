Supreme Court of the United States
Nathaniel JONES, Petitioner,
v.
UNITED STATES.
No. 97–6203.

Argued Oct. 5, 1998.
|
Decided March 24, 1999.
 
Justice SCALIA, concurring.

In dissenting in Almendarez–Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), I suggested the possibility, and in dissenting in Monge v. California, 524 U.S. 721, 737, 118 S.Ct. 2246, 141 L.Ed.2d 615 (1998), I set forth as my considered view, that it is unconstitutional to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that alter the congressionally prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed. Because I think it necessary to resolve all ambiguities in criminal statutes in such fashion as to avoid violation of this constitutional principle, I join the opinion of the Court.
