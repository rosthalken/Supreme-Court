Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor join, concurring.

Advancing price impact consideration from the merits stage to the certification stage may broaden the scope of discovery available at certification. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-37. But the Court recognizes that it is incumbent upon the defendant to show the absence of price impact. See ante, at ___ - ___, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 357. The Court’s judgment, therefore,  [***46] should impose no heavy toll on securities-fraud plaintiffs with tenable claims. On that understanding, I join the Court’s opinion.
