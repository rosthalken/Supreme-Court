100 S. Ct.1868
HANRAHAN ET AL. v. HAMPTON ET AL.
Supreme Court of the United States
April 30, 1980 
No. 79-912

MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST.
 [*1868]  Plaintiffs-respondents and their counsel in these cases have moved that I "be recused from the proceedings in this case" for the reasons stated in their 14-page motion and their five Appendices filed with the Clerk of this Court on April 3, 1980. The motion is opposed by the state-defendant petitioners in the action. Since generally the Court as an institution leaves such motions, even though they be addressed to it, to the decision of the individual Justices to  [*1869]  whom they refer, see Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers , 325 U.S. 897 (1945) (denial of petition for rehearing) (Jackson, J., concurring), I shall treat the motion as addressed to me individually. I have considered the motion, the Appendices, the response of the state defendants, 28 U. S. C. § 455 (1976 ed. and [***2]  Supp. III), and the current American Bar Association Code of Judicial Conduct, and the motion is accordingly
denied .
