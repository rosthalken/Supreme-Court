130 L. Ed. 2d 483
IN RE DOW JONES AND COMPANY, INC.
Supreme Court of the United States
December 5, 1994, Decided
No. A-369

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, Circuit Justice.
On November 3, 1994, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Division for Appointing Independent Counsels, issued an order denying Down Jones & Company, Inc.'s (Dow Jones) "Motion for Disclosure of an Access to Report of Former Independent Counsel Robert B. Fiske." That order was filed "under seal," apparently to prohibit Dow Jones from publishing or reporting on the order or its contents. Dow Jones subsequently filed a Motion to Unseal the November 3, 1994 Order (which has not been ruled on) and a Motion for Reconsideration of the November 3, 1994 Order.
On November 22, 1994, Dow Jones filed in this Court an Emergency Application for Stay of the November 3, 1994 Order, seeking permission only to publish and report on the Court of Appeals' order and its contents. The following day, the Court of Appeals denied Dow Jones' previously filed Motion for Reconsideration by an order in which it discussed the November 3, 1994 Order and its contents, and gave its reasons for refusing to release the report of Independent [**2]  Counsel Fiske. This order was not filed "under seal," and there is no indication that Dow Jones is prohibited from reporting on or publishing this order. Because Dow Jones may report on and publish this second order, which refers to the November 3, 1994 Order and its contents, I believe that Dow Jones' Emergency Application for Stay is moot.
