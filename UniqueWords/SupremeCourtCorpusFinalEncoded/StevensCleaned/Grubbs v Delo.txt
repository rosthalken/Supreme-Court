For me, the respondent's failure to file a motion to vacate the stay entered by Justice Blackmun is a sufficient reason for allowing that stay to remain in effect. Moreover, if such a motion were filed, I would vote to deny it because I do not believe the petition for certiorari should be acted upon before the Court decides the pending case of Herrera v. Collins, No. 91-7328.
