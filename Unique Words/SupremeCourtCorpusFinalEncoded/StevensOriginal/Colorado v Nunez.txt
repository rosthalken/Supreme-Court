JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.

In view of the growing public interest in the magnitude of our workload, 1Link to the text of the note [****9]   [***342]  I have on occasion taken note of some of the ways in which the present Court makes use of its resources. Several years ago, I expressed concern about the purely advisory  [*328]  character of individual opinions dissenting from  [**1259]  orders denying petitions for certiorari. See Singleton v. Commissioner, 439 U.S. 940, 944-945 (1978)  [****8]  (opinion of STEVENS, J.). More recently I have noted that the Court is prone to grant certiorari in cases that do not merit our attention. See Watt v. Alaska, 451 U.S. 259, 273-276 (1981) (STEVENS, J., concurring); see also Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc., 462 U.S. 36, 72-73 (1983) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). 2Link to the text of the note Last Term, in South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U.S. 553 (1983), and Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032 (1983), the Court decided to enlarge its power to review state-court decisions. I dissented from those novel assertions of appellate jurisdiction in part because I was concerned about the undesirability of the rendition of purely advisory opinions by this Court. See id., at 1065 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); 459 U.S., at 566 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); see also 463 U.S., at 1054 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in part and in judgment in Michigan v. Long) (noting "an increased danger of advisory opinions in the Court's new approach").

Today JUSTICE WHITE "[agrees] that the challenged judgment rests solely on state-law grounds and that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review it." Ante, at 327. He nevertheless provides us with an advisory opinion, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE O'CONNOR join, concerning the merits of the case. We of course have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction over this case, but once we agree that we lack jurisdiction, this case no more provides a vehicle for deciding the question upon which three Justices now volunteer an opinion than if the petition for a writ of certiorari had never been filed. I, of course, fully respect their right to their opinions concerning that question, just as I respect other scholars who disagree with the wisdom of the choice made in Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792). I merely note that today's advisory opinion is consistent with the Court's  [*329]  emerging tendency to enlarge its own involvement in litigation conducted by state courts.  [****10]  This tendency feeds on itself, for it can only encourage litigants -- particularly institutional litigants -- to file even more petitions for certiorari in the hope of obtaining, if not review and reversal, at least an opinion by a number of Supreme Court Justices in support of their position. In light of the increasing flood of certiorari petitions, today's advisory opinion provides further support for concluding that this situation "will very likely progressively worsen." 3Link to the text of the note
