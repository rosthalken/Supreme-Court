Supreme Court of the United States
CITICORP INDUSTRIAL CREDIT, INC., Petitioner
v.
William E. BROCK, Secretary of Labor.
No. 86-88.
|
Argued April 20, 1987.
|
Decided June 22, 1987.
 

Justice SCALIA, concurring.

While I would affirm the Court of Appeals even if I agreed with petitioner that “the sole aim of the FLSA was to establish decent wages and hours for American workers,” ante, at 2700, and that this goal “is not furthered by application of § 15(a)(1)” to secured creditors, ibid., I do not disagree with the Court’s conclusions in Part II-B, and therefore join its opinion in full.
