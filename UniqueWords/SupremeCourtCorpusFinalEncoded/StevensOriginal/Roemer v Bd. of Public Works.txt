MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
My views are substantially those expressed by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN.However, I would add emphasis to the pernicious tendency of a state subsidy to tempt religious schools to compromise their religious mission without wholly abandoning it. The disease of entanglement may infect a law discouraging wholesome religious activity as well as a law encouraging the propagation of a given faith.
