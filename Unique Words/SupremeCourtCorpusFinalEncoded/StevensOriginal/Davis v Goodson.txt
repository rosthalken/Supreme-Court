
        
        Davis v. Goodson, 459 U.S. 1154, 103 S. Ct. 798 (1983)
        


   

   JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.

Because the petition for a writ of certiorari does not affirmatively show that a federal question was presented to or decided by the Supreme Court of Arkansas, I believe the Court correctly denies the writ.
