If the Court were prepared to re-examine this area of the law, I would vote to reverse this conviction with instructions to dismiss the indictment. See Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 198 (STEVENS, J., concurring and dissenting); Smith v. United States, 431 U.S. 291, 311 (STEVENS, J., dissenting);     Splawn v. California, 431 U.S. 595, 602 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Ward v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 767, 777 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). But my     views are not now the law. The opinion that THE CHIEF JUSTICE has written is faithful to the cases on which it relies. For that reason, and because a fifth vote is necessary to dispose of this case, I join his opinion.
