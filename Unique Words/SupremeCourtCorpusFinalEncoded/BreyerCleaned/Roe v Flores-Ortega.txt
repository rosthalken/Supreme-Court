
I write to emphasize that the question presented concerned the filing of a "notice of appeal following a guilty plea." Pet. for Cert. i (emphasis added). In that context I agree with the Court. I also join its opinion, which, in my view, makes clear that counsel does "almost always" have a constitutional duty to consult with a defendant about an appeal after a trial. Post, at 1 (SOUTER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); cf. ante, at 7-9.
