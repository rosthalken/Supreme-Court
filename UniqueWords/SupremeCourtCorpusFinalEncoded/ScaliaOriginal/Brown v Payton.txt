Supreme Court of the United States
Jill L. BROWN, Warden, Petitioner,
v.
William Charles PAYTON.
No. 03-1039.
|
Argued Nov. 10, 2004.
|
Decided March 22, 2005. Rehearing Denied May 16, 2005. See 544 U.S. 1045, 125 S.Ct. 2248.
Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, concurring.

I join the Court’s opinion, which correctly holds that the California Supreme Court’s decision was not “contrary to” or “an unreasonable application of” our cases. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). Even if our review were not circumscribed by statute, I would adhere to my view that limiting a jury’s discretion to consider all mitigating evidence does not violate *148 the Eighth Amendment. See Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639, 673, 110 S.Ct. 3047, 111 L.Ed.2d 511 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
