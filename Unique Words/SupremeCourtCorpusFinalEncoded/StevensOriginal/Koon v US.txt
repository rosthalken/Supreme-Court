No. 94-1664 

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

518 U.S. 81

February 20, 1996, Argued 
June 13, 1996 *, Decided

JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
In my opinion the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it relied on the unusual collateral employment consequences faced by these petitioners as a result of their convictions. I therefore except Part IV-B-1 from my otherwise complete [***423]  endorsement of the Court's opinion. I also note that I do not understand the opinion to foreclose the District Court from basing a downward departure on an aggregation of factors each of which might in itself be insufficient to justify a departure.
