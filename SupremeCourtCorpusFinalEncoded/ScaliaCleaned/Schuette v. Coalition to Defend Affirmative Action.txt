
It has come to this. Called upon to explore the jurisprudential twilight zone between two errant lines of precedent,     we confront a frighteningly bizarre question: Does the    Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbid what its text plainly requires? Needless to say (except that this case obliges us to say it), the question answers itself. “The Constitution proscribes government discrimination on the basis of race, and state-provided education is no exception.” Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 349, 123 S. Ct. 2325, 156 L. Ed. 2d 304 (2003) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). It is precisely this understanding—the correct understanding—of the federal Equal Protection Clause that the people of the State of Michigan have adopted for their own fundamental law. By adopting it, they did not simultaneously offend it.

Even taking this Court’s sorry line of race-based-admissions cases as a given, I find the question presented only slightly less strange: Does the Equal Protection Clause forbid a State from banning a practice that the Clause barely—and only provisionally—permits? Reacting to those race-based-admissions decisions, some States—whether deterred by the prospect of costly litigation; aware that Grutter’s bell may soon toll, see 539 U.S., at 343, 123 S. Ct. 2325, 156 L. Ed. 2d 304; or simply opposed in principle to the notion of “benign” racial discrimination—have gotten out of the racial-preferences    business altogether. And with our express encouragement: “Universities in California, Florida, and Washington State, where racial preferences in admissions are prohibited by state law, are currently engaging in experimenting with a wide variety of alternative approaches. Universities in other States can and should draw on the most promising aspects of these race-neutral alternatives as they develop.” Id., at 342, 123 S. Ct. 2325, 156 L. Ed. 2d 304 (emphasis added). Respondents seem to think this admonition was merely in jest. 1Link to the text of the note The experiment,     they maintain, is not only over; it never rightly began. Neither the people of the States nor their legislatures ever had the option of directing subordinate public-university officials to cease considering the race of applicants, since that would deny members of those minority groups the option of enacting a policy designed to further their interest, thus denying them the equal protection of the laws. Never mind that it is hotly disputed whether the practice of race-based admissions is ever in a racial minority’s interest. Cf. id., at 371-373, 123 S. Ct. 2325, 156 L. Ed. 2d 304 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). And never mind that, were a public university to stake its defense of a race-based-admissions    policy on the ground that it was designed to benefit primarily minorities (as opposed to all students, regardless of color, by enhancing diversity), we would hold the policy unconstitutional. See id., at 322-325, 123 S. Ct. 2325, 156 L. Ed. 2d 304 .

But the battleground for this case is not the constitutionality of race-based admissions—at least, not quite. Rather, it is the so-called political-process doctrine, derived from this Court’s opinions in Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896 (1982), and Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 89 S. Ct. 557, 21 L. Ed. 2d     616 (1969). I agree with those parts of the plurality opinion that repudiate this doctrine. But I do not agree with its reinterpretation of Seattleand Hunter, which makes them stand in part for the cloudy and doctrinally anomalous proposition that whenever state action poses “the serious risk . . . of causing specific injuries on account of race,” it denies equal protection. Ante, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 624. I would instead reaffirm that the “ordinary principles of our law [and] of our democratic heritage”    require “plaintiffs alleging equal protection violations” stemming from facially neutral acts to “prove intent and causation and not merely the existence of racial disparity.” Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 506, 112 S. Ct. 1430, 118 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring) (citing Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S. Ct. 2040, 48 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1976)). I would further hold that a law directing state actors to provide equal protection is (to say the least) facially neutral, and cannot violate the Constitution. Section 26 of the Michigan Constitution (formerly Proposal 2) rightly stands.

A
The political-process doctrine has its roots in two of our cases. The first is Hunter. In 1964, the Akron City Council passed a fair-housing ordinance “‘assur[ing] equal opportunity to all persons to live in decent housing facilities regardless of race, color, religion, ancestry or national origin.’” 393 U.S., at 386, 89 S. Ct. 557, 21 L. Ed. 2d 616. Soon after, the city’s voters passed an amendment to the Akron City Charter stating that any ordinance enacted by the council that “‘regulates’” commercial transactions in real property “‘on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin or ancestry’”—including the already enacted 1964 ordinance—“must first be approved by a majority of    the electors voting on the question” at a later referendum. Id., at 387, 89 S. Ct. 557, 21 L. Ed. 2d 616. The question was whether the charter amendment denied equal protection. Answering yes, the Court explained that “although the law on its face treats Negro and white, Jew and gentile in an identical manner, the reality     is that the law’s impact falls on the minority. The majority needs no protection against discrimination.” Id., at 391, 89 S. Ct. 557, 21 L. Ed. 2d 616. By placing a “special burden on racial minorities within the governmental processes,” the amendment “disadvantage[d]” a racial minority “by making it more difficult to enact legislation in its behalf.” Id., at 391, 393, 89 S. Ct. 557, 21 L. Ed. 2d 616.

The reasoning in Seattle is of a piece. Resolving to “eliminate all [racial] imbalance from the Seattle public schools,” the city school board passed a mandatory busing and pupil-reassignment plan of the sort typically imposed on districts guilty of de jure segregation. 458 U.S., at 460-461, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896. A year later, the citizens of the State of Washington passed Initiative 350, which directed (with exceptions) that “‘no    school . . . shall directly or indirectly require any student to attend a school other than the school which is geographically nearest or next nearest the student’s place of residence . . . and which offers the course of study pursued by such student,’” permitting only court-ordered race-based busing. Id., at 462, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896. The lower courts held Initiative 350 unconstitutional, and we affirmed, announcing in the prelude     of our analysis—as though it were beyond debate—that the Equal Protection Clause forbade laws that “subtly distor[t] governmental processes in such a way as to place special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.” Id., at 467, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896.

The first question in Seattle was whether the subject matter of Initiative 350 was a “‘racial’ issue,” triggering Hunter and its process doctrine. 458 U.S., at 471-472, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896. It was “undoubtedly. . . true” that whites and blacks were “counted among both the supporters and the opponents of Initiative 350.” Id., at 472, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896. It was “equally clear” that both white and black children benefited from desegregated schools. Ibid. Nonetheless, we concluded that desegregation “inures primarily to the benefit of the minority, and is designed    for that purpose.” Ibid. (emphasis added). In any event, it was “enough that minorities may consider busing for integration to be ‘legislation that is in their interest.’” Id., at 474, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896 (quoting Hunter, supra, at 395, 89 S. Ct. 557, 21 L. Ed. 2d 616 (Harlan, J., concurring)).

So we proceeded to the heart of the political-process analysis. We held Initiative 350 unconstitutional, since it removed “the authority to address a racial problem—and only a racial problem—from the existing decisionmaking body, in such a way as to burden minority interests.” Seattle, 458 U.S., at 474, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896. Although school boards in Washington retained authority over other student-assignment issues and over most matters of educational policy generally, under Initiative 350, minorities favoring race-based busing would have to “surmount a considerably higher hurdle” than the mere petitioning of a local assembly: They “now must seek relief from the state legislature, or from the statewide electorate,” a “different level of government.” Ibid.

The relentless logic of Hunter and Seattle would point to a similar conclusion in this case. In those cases, one level of government exercised borrowed authority over an apparently “racial issue,” until a higher level    of government called the loan. So too here. In those cases, we deemed the revocation an equal-protection violation regardless of whether it facially classified according to race or reflected an invidious purpose to discriminate. Here, the Court of Appeals did the same.

The plurality sees it differently. Though it, too, disavows the political-process-doctrine basis on which Hunter and    Seattle were decided, ante, at ___ - ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 624-627, it does not take the next step of overruling those cases. Rather, it reinterprets them beyond recognition. Hunter, the plurality suggests, was a case in which the challenged act had “target[ed] racial minorities.” Ante, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 623. Maybe, but the Hunter Court neither found that to be so nor considered it relevant, bypassing the question of intent entirely, satisfied that its newly minted political-process theory sufficed to invalidate the charter amendment.

As for Seattle, what was really going on, according to the plurality, was that Initiative 350 had the consequence (if not the purpose) of preserving the harms effected by prior de jure segregation. Thus, “the political restriction     in question was designed to be used, or was likely to be used, to encourage infliction of    injury by reason of race.” Ante, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 629. That conclusion is derived not from the opinion but from recently discovered evidence that the city of Seattle had been a cause of its schools’ racial imbalance all along: “Although there had been no judicial finding of de jure segregation with respect to Seattle’s school district, it appears as though school segregation in the district in the 1940’s and 1950’s may have been the partial result of school board policies.” Ante, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 624. 2Link to the text of the note That the district’s effort to end racial imbalance had been stymied by Initiative 350 meant that the people, by passing it, somehow had become complicit in Seattle’s equal-protection-denying status quo, whether they knew it or not. Hence, there was in Seattle a government-furthered “infliction of a specific”—and, presumably, constitutional—“injury.” Ante, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 627.

Once again this describes what our opinion in Seattle might have been, but assuredly not what it was. The opinion assumes throughout that Seattle’s schools suffered at most from de facto segregation, see, e.g., 458 U.S., at 474, 475, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896that is, segregation not the “product . . . of state action but of private choices,” having no “constitutional implications,” Freeman, 503 U.S., at 495-496, 112 S. Ct. 1430, 118 L. Ed. 2d 108. Nor did it anywhere state that the current racial imbalance was the (judicially remediable) effect of prior de jure segregation. Absence of de jure segregation or the effects of de jure segregation was a necessary premise of the Seattle opinion. That is what made the issue of busing and pupil reassignment a matter of political choice rather than judicial mandate. 3Link to the text of the note And precisely because it was a question for the political branches to decide, the manner—which is to say, the process—of its resolution implicated the Court’s new process theory. The    opinion itself says this: “[I]n the absence of a constitutional violation, the desirability and efficacy of school desegregation are matters to be resolved through the political process. For present purposes, it is enough [to hold reallocation of that political decision to a higher level unconstitutional] that minorities may consider     busing for integration to be legislation that is in their interest.” 458 U.S., at 474, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896 (internal quotation marks omitted).



B
Patently atextual, unadministrable, and contrary to our traditional     equal-protection jurisprudence, Hunterand Seattleshould be overruled.

The problems with the political-process doctrine begin with its triggering prong, which assigns to a court the task of determining whether a law that reallocates policymaking authority concerns a “racial issue.” Seattle, 458 U.S., at 473, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896. Seattle takes a couple of dissatisfying cracks at defining    this crucial term. It suggests that an issue is racial if adopting one position on the question would “at bottom inur[e] primarily to the benefit of the minority, and is designed for that purpose.” Id., at 472, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896. It is irrelevant that, as in Hunter and Seattle, 458 U.S., at 472, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896, both the racial minority and the racial majority benefit from the policy in question, and members of both groups favor it. Judges should instead focus their guesswork on their own juridical sense of what is primarily for the benefit of minorities. Cf. ibid. (regarding as dispositive what “our cases” suggest is beneficial to minorities). On second thought, maybe judges need only ask this question: Is it possible “that minorities may consider” the policy in question to be “in their interest”? Id., at 474, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896. If so, you can be sure that you are dealing with a “racial issue.” 4Link to the text of the note

No good can come of such random judicial musing. The plurality gives two convincing reasons why. For one thing, it involves judges in the dirty business of dividing    the Nation “into racial blocs,” Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547, 603, 610, 110 S. Ct. 2997, 111 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting); ante, at ___ - ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 625-627. That task is as difficult as it is unappealing. (Does a half-Latino, half-American Indian have Latino interests, American-Indian interests, both, half of both? 5Link to the text of the note) What is worse, the exercise promotes the noxious fiction that, knowing only a person’s color or ethnicity, we can be sure that he has a predetermined set of policy “interests,” thus “reinforc[ing] the perception that members of the same racial     group—regardless of their age, education, economic status, or the community in which they live—think alike,     [and] share the same political interests.” 6Link to the text of the note Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 647, 113 S. Ct. 2816, 125 L. Ed. 2d 511 (1993). Whether done by a judge or a school board, such “racial stereotyping [is] at odds with equal protection mandates.” Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 920, 115 S. Ct. 2475, 132 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1995).

But that is not the “racial issue” prong’s only defect. More fundamentally, it misreads the Equal Protection Clause to protect “particular group[s],” a construction that we have tirelessly repudiated in a “long line of cases understanding equal protection as a personal right.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.S. 200, 224, 230, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 132 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1995). It is a “basic principle that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution protect persons, not groups.” Id., at 227, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 132 L. Ed. 2d 158; Metro Broadcasting, supra, at 636, 110 S. Ct. 2997, 111 L. Ed. 2d 445 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). 7Link to the text of the note Yet Seattle insists that only those political-process alterations that burden racial minorities deny equal protection. “The majority,” after all, “needs no protection against discrimination.” 458 U.S., at 468, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S., at 391, 89 S. Ct. 557, 21 L. Ed. 2d 616). In the years since Seattle, we have repeatedly rejected “a    reading of the guarantee of equal protection under which the level of scrutiny varies according to the ability of different groups to defend their interests in the representative process.” Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 495, 109 S. Ct. 706, 102 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1989). Meant to obliterate rather than endorse the practice of racial classifications, the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantees “obtai[n] with equal force regardless of ‘the race of those burdened or benefited.’” Miller, supra, at 904, 115 S. Ct. 2475, 132 L. Ed. 2d 762 (quoting Croson, supra, at 494, 109 S. Ct. 706, 102 L. Ed. 2d 854 (plurality opinion)); Adarand, supra, at 223, 227, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 132 L. Ed. 2d 158. The Equal Protection Clause “cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color. If both are not accorded the same protection it is not equal.” Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 289-290, 98 S. Ct. 2733, 57 L. Ed. 2d 750 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.).

The dissent trots out the old saw, derived from dictum in a footnote, that legislation motivated by “‘prejudice against discrete and insular minorities’” merits “‘more exacting judicial scrutiny.’” Post, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 662 (quoting United States v. Carolene Products, 304 U.S. 144, 152-153, n. 4, 58 S. Ct. 778, 82 L. Ed. 1234). I say derived from that dictum (expressed by the four-Justice majority     of a seven-Justice Court) because the dictum itself merely said “[n]or need we enquire . . . whether prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition,” id., at 153, n. 4, 58 S. Ct. 778, 82 L. Ed. 1234 (emphasis added). The     dissent does not argue, of course, that such “prejudice” produced §26. Nor does it explain why certain racial minorities in Michigan qualify as “‘insular,’” meaning that “other groups will not form coalitions with them—and, critically, not because of lack of common interests but because of ‘prejudice.’” Strauss, Is Carolene Products Obsolete? 2010 U. Ill. L. Rev. 1251, 1257. Nor does it even make the case that a    group’s “discreteness” and “insularity” are political liabilities rather than political strengths 8Link to the text of the note—a serious question that alone demonstrates the prudence of the Carolene Products dictumizers in leaving the “enquir[y]” for another day. As for the question whether “legislation which restricts those political processes which can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation . . . is to be subjected to more exacting judicial scrutiny,” the Carolene Products Court found it “unnecessary to consider [that] now.” 304 U.S., at 152, n. 4, 58 S. Ct. 778, 82 L. Ed. 1234. If the dissent thinks that worth considering today, it should explain why the election of a university’s governing board is a “political process which can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation,” but Michigan voters’ ability to amend their Constitution is not. It seems to me quite the opposite. Amending the Constitution requires the approval of only “a majority of the electors voting on the question.” Mich. Const., Art. XII, §2. By contrast, voting in a favorable board (each of which has eight members) at the three major public universities requires electing by majority vote at least 15 different    candidates, several of whom would be running during different election cycles. See BAMN v. Regents of Univ. of Mich., 701 F.3d 466, 508 (CA6 2012) (Sutton, J., dissenting). So if Michigan voters, instead of amending their Constitution, had pursued the dissent’s preferred path of electing board members promising to “abolish race-sensitive admissions policies,” post, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 645, it would have been harder, not easier, for racial minorities favoring affirmative action to overturn that decision. But the more important point is that we should not design our jurisprudence to conform to dictum in a footnote in a four-Justice opinion.



C
Moving from the appalling to the absurd, I turn    now to the second part of the Hunter-Seattle analysis—which is apparently no more administrable than the first, compare post, at ___ - ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 642-644 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) (“This case . . . does not involve a reordering of the political process”), with post, at ___ - ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 658-661 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (yes, it does). This part of the inquiry directs a court to determine whether the challenged act “place[s] effective decisionmaking authority     over [the] racial issue at a different level of government.” Seattle, 458 U.S., at 474, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896. The laws in both Hunter and Seattle were thought to fail this test. In both cases, “the effect of the challenged action was to redraw decisionmaking authority over racial matters—and only over racial matters—in such a way as to place comparative burdens on minorities.” 458 U.S., at 475, n. 17, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896. This, we said, a State may not do.

    By contrast, in another line of cases, we have emphasized the near-limitless sovereignty of each State to design its governing structure as it sees fit. Generally, “a State is afforded wide leeway when experimenting with the appropriate allocation of state legislative power” and may create “political subdivisions such as cities and counties .    . . ‘as convenient agencies for exercising such of the governmental powers of the state as may be entrusted to them.’” Holt Civic Club v. Tuscaloosa, 439 U.S. 60, 71, 99 S. Ct. 383, 58 L. Ed. 2d 292 (1978) (quoting Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U.S. 161, 178, 28 S. Ct. 40, 52 L. Ed. 151 (1907)). Accordingly, States have “absolute discretion” to determine the “number, nature and duration of the powers conferred upon [municipal] corporations and the territory over which they shall be exercised.” Holt Civic Club, supra, at 71, 99 S. Ct. 383, 58 L. Ed. 2d 292. So it would seem to go without saying that a State may give certain powers to cities, later assign the same powers to counties, and even reclaim them for itself.

Taken to the limits of its logic, Hunter-Seattle is the gaping exception that nearly swallows the rule of structural state sovereignty. If indeed the Fourteenth Amendment forbids States to “place effective decisionmaking authority over” racial issues at “different level[s] of government,” then it must be true that the Amendment’s ratification in 1868 worked a partial ossification of each State’s governing structure, rendering basically irrevocable the power of any subordinate state official who, the day before the Fourteenth Amendment’s passage, happened to enjoy legislatively    conferred authority over a “racial issue.” Under the Fourteenth Amendment, that subordinate entity (suppose it is a city council) could itself take action on the issue, action either favorable or unfavorable to minorities. It could even reverse itself later. What it could not do, however, is redelegate its power to an even lower level of state government (such as a city-council committee) without forfeiting it, since the necessary effect of wresting it back would be to put an additional obstacle in the path of minorities. Likewise, no entity or official higher up the state chain (e.g., a county board) could exercise authority over the issue. Nor, even, could the state legislature, or the people by constitutional amendment, revoke the legislative conferral of power to the subordinate, whether the city council, its subcommittee, or the county board. Seattle’s logic would create affirmative-action safe havens wherever subordinate officials in public universities (1) traditionally have enjoyed “effective decisionmaking authority” over admissions policy but (2) have not yet used that authority to prohibit race-conscious admissions decisions. The mere existence of a subordinate’s discretion    over the matter would work a kind of reverse pre-emption. It is “a strange notion—alien to our system—that local governmental     bodies can forever pre-empt the ability of a State—the sovereign power—to address a matter of compelling concern to the State.” 458 U.S., at 495, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896 (Powell, J., dissenting). But that is precisely what the political-process doctrine contemplates.

Perhaps the spirit of Seattle is especially disquieted by enactments of constitutional amendments. That appears to be the dissent’s position. The problem with §26, it suggests, is that amending Michigan’s Constitution is simply not a part of that State’s “existing” political process. E.g., post, at ___, ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 646, 668. What a peculiar notion: that a revision of a State’s fundamental law, made in precisely the manner that law prescribes, by the very people who are the source of that law’s authority, is not part of the “political process” which, but for those people and that law, would not exist. This will surely come as news to     the people of Michigan, who, since 1914, have amended their Constitution 20 times. Brief for Gary Segura et al. as Amici Curiae 12. Even so, the dissent concludes that the amendment attacked here worked an illicit    “chang[ing] [of ] the basic rules of the political process in that State” in “the middle of the game.” Post, at ___, ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 645, 646. Why, one might ask, is not the amendment provision of the Michigan Constitution one (perhaps the most basic one) of the rules of the State’s political process? And why does democratic invocation of that provision not qualify as working through the “existing political process,” post, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 668? 9Link to the text of the note



II
I part ways with Hunter, Seattle, and (I think) the plurality for an additional reason: Each endorses a version of the proposition that a facially neutral    law may deny equal protection solely because it has a disparate racial impact. Few equal-protection theories have been so squarely and soundly rejected. “An unwavering line of cases from this Court holds that a violation of the Equal Protection Clause requires state action motivated by discriminatory intent,” Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 372-373, 111 S. Ct. 1859, 114 L. Ed. 2d 395 (1991) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment), and that “official action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in a racially disproportionate impact,” Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264-265, 97 S. Ct. 555, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1977). Indeed, we affirmed this principle the same day we decided Seattle: “[E]ven when a neutral law has a disproportionately adverse effect on a racial minority, the Fourteenth Amendment is violated only if a discriminatory purpose can be shown.” Crawford v. Board of Ed. of Los Angeles, 458 U.S. 527, 537-538, 102 S. Ct. 3211, 73 L. Ed. 2d 948 (1982).

Notwithstanding our dozens of cases confirming the exception-less     nature of the Washington v. Davis rule, the plurality opinion leaves ajar an effects-test escape hatch modeled after Hunter and Seattle, suggesting that state action denies equal protection when it “ha[s]    the serious risk, if not purpose, of causing specific injuries on account of race,” or is either “designed to be used, or . . . likely to be used, to encourage infliction of injury by reason of race.” Ante, at ___, ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 624, 629 (emphasis added). Since these formulations enable a determination of an equal-protection violation where there is no discriminatory intent, they are inconsistent with the long Washington v. Davis line of cases. 10Link to the text of the note

Respondents argue that we need not bother with the discriminatory-purpose test, since §26 may be struck more straightforwardly as a racial “classification.”     Admitting (as they must) that §26 does not on    its face “distribut[e] burdens or benefits on the basis of individual racial classifications,” Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 720, 127 S. Ct. 2738, 168 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2007), respondents rely on Seattle’s statement that “when the political process or the decisionmaking mechanism used to address racially conscious legislation—and only such legislation—is singled out for peculiar and disadvantageous treatment,” then that “singling out” is a racial classification. 458 U.S., at 485, 486, n. 30, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896. But this is just the political-process theory bedecked in different doctrinal dress. A law that “neither says nor implies that persons are to be treated differently on account of their race” is not a racial classification. Crawford, supra, at 537, 102 S. Ct. 3211, 73 L. Ed. 2d 948. That is particularly true of statutes mandating equal treatment. “[A] law that prohibits the State from classifying individuals by race . . . a fortiori does not classify individuals by race.” Coalition for Economic Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 692, 702 (CA9 1997) (O’Scannlain, J.).

Thus, the question in this case, as in every case in which neutral state action is said to deny equal protection on account of race, is whether the action reflects    a racially discriminatory purpose. Seattle stresses that “singling out the political processes affecting racial issues for uniquely disadvantageous treatment inevitably raises dangers of impermissible motivation.” 458 U.S., at 486, n. 30, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896. True enough, but that motivation must be proved. And respondents do not have a prayer of proving it here. The District Court noted that, under “conventional equal protection” doctrine, the suit was “doom[ed].” 539 F. Supp. 2d 924, 951 (ED Mich. 2008). Though the Court of Appeals did not opine on this question, I would not leave it for them on remand. In my view, any law expressly requiring state actors to afford all persons equal protection of the laws (such as Initiative 350 in Seattle, though not the charter amendment in Hunter) does not—    cannot—deny “to any person . . . equal protection of the laws,” U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1, regardless of whatever evidence of seemingly foul purposes plaintiffs may cook up in the trial court.

As Justice Harlan observed over a century ago, “[o]ur Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.” Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 559, 16 S. Ct. 1138, 41 L. Ed. 256 (1896) (dissenting opinion). The people    of Michigan wish the same for their governing charter. It would be shameful for us to stand in their way. 


1. For simplicity’s sake, I use “respondent” or “respondents” throughout the opinion to describe only those parties who are adverse to petitioner, not Eric Russell, a respondent who supports petitioner.

2. The plurality cites evidence from Justice Breyer’s dissent in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 127 S. Ct. 2738, 168 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2007), to suggest that the city had been a “partial” cause of its segregation problem. Ante, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 624. The plurality in Parents Involved criticized that dissent for relying on irrelevant evidence, for “elid[ing the]    distinction between de jure and de facto segregation,” and for “casually intimat[ing] that Seattle’s school attendance patterns reflect[ed] illegal segregation.” 551 U.S., at 736-737, 127 S. Ct. 2738, 168 L. Ed. 2d 508, and n. 15. Today’s plurality sides with the dissent and repeats its errors.

3. Or so the Court assumed. See 458 U.S., at 472, n. 15, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896 (“Appellants and the United States do not challenge the propriety of race-conscious student assignments for the purpose of achieving integration, even absent a finding of prior de jure segregation. We therefore do not specifically pass on that issue”).

4. The dissent’s version of this test is just as scattershot. Since, according to the dissent, the doctrine forbids “reconfigur[ing] the political process in a manner that burdens only a racial minority,” post, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 646 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.) (emphasis added), it must be that the reason the underlying issue (that is, the issue concerning which    the process has been reconfigured) is “racial” is that the policy in question benefits only a racial minority (if it also benefited persons not belonging to a racial majority, then the political-process reconfiguration would burden them as well). On second thought: The issue is “racial” if the policy benefits primarily a racial minority and “‘[is] designed for that purpose,’” post, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 670. This is the standard Seattle purported to apply. But under that standard, §26 does not affect a “racial issue,” because under Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 123 S. Ct. 2325, 156 L. Ed. 2d 304 (2003), race-based admissions policies may not constitutionally be “designed for [the] purpose,” Seattle, supra, at 472, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896, of benefitting primarily racial minorities, but must be designed for the purpose of achieving educational benefits for students of all races, Grutter, supra, at 322-325, 123 S. Ct. 2325, 156 L. Ed. 2d 304. So the dissent must mean that an issue is “racial” so long as the policy in question has the incidental effect (an effect not flowing from its design) of benefiting primarily racial minorities.

5. And how many members of a particular racial group must take the same position on an issue before we suppose that the position is in the entire group’s interest? Not every member, the dissent suggests, post, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 670. Beyond that, who knows? Five percent? Eighty-five percent?

6. The dissent proves my point. After asserting—without citation, though I and many others of all races deny it—that it is “common-sense reality” that affirmative action benefits racial minorities, post, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 635, the dissent suggests throughout, e.g., post, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 661, that that view of “reality” is so necessarily shared by members of racial minorities that they must favor affirmative action.

7. The dissent contends, post, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 667, that this point “ignores the obvious: Discrimination against an individual occurs because of that individual’s membership in a particular group.” No, I do not ignore the obvious; it is the dissent that misses the point. Of course discrimination against a group constitutes discrimination against each member of that    group. But since it is persons and not groups that are protected, one cannot say, as the dissent would, that the Constitution prohibits discrimination against minority groups, but not against majority groups.

8. Cf., e.g., Ackerman, Beyond Carolene Products, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 713, 723-724 (1985) (“Other things being equal, ‘discreteness and insularity’ will normally be a source of enormous bargaining advantage, not disadvantage, for a group engaged in pluralist American politics. Except for special cases, the concerns that underlie Carolene should lead judges to protect groups that possess the opposite characteristic from the ones Carolene emphasizes—groups that are ‘anonymous and diffuse’ rather than ‘discrete and insular’”).

9. The dissent thinks I do not understand its argument. Only when amending Michigan’s Constitution violates Hunter-Seattle, it says, is that constitutionally prescribed activity necessarily not part of the State’s existing political process. Post, at ___, n. 7, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 656. I understand the argument quite well; and see quite well that it begs the question. Why is Michigan’s action here unconstitutional? Because it violates Hunter-Seattle. And why does it violate Hunter-Seattle? Because it is not part of the State’s existing political process. And why is it not part of the State’s existing political process? Because it violates Hunter-Seattle.

10. According to the dissent, Hunter-Seattle fills an important doctrinal gap left open by Washington v. Davis, since Hunter-Seattle’s rule—unique among equal-protection principles—makes clear that “the majority” may not alter a political process with the goal of “prevent[ing] minority groups from partaking in that process on equal footing.” Post, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 663. Nonsense. There is no gap. To “manipulate the ground rules,” post, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 664, or to “ri[g] the contest,” post, at ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 664, in order to harm persons because of their race is to deny equal protection under Washington v. Davis.

11. And doubly shameful to equate “the majority” behind §26 with “the majority” responsible for Jim Crow. Post, at ___ - ___, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 644-645 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).
