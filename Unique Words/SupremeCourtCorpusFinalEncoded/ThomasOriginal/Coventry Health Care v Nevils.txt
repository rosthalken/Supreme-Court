COVENTRY HEALTH CARE OF MISSOURI, INC., fka GROUP HEALTH PLAN, INC., Petitioner v. JODIE NEVILS

No. 16-149.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

137 S. Ct. 1190

March 1, 2017, Argued 
April 18, 2017, Decided

Justice Thomas, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court with one reservation. A statute that confers on an executive agency the power to enter into contracts that pre-empt state law—such as the Federal Employee    Health Benefits Act of 1959, 5 U. S. C. §8902—might unlawfully delegate legislative power to the President insofar as the statute fails sufficiently to constrain the President’s contracting discretion. See DOT v.  [**584]  Ass'n of Am. R.R., 575 U. S. ___, ___-___, 135 S. Ct. 1225, 1246-1252, 191 L. Ed. 2d 153, 175-182 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) ;  [*1200]  see also Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 472, 121 S. Ct. 903, 149 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2001). Respondent, however, failed to make that argument. The Court therefore appropriately leaves that issue to be decided, if at all, on remand.
