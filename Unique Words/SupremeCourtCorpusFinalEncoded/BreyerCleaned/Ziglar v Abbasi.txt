
In Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1971), this Court held that the Fourth Amendment provides a damages remedy for those whom federal officials have injured as a result of an unconstitutional search or seizure. In Davis v. Passman, 442 U. S. 228, 99 S. Ct. 2264, 60 L. Ed. 2d 846 (1979), the Court held that the Fifth Amendment provides a damages remedy to an individual dismissed by her employer (a Member of Congress) on the basis of her sex in violation of the equal protection component of that Amendment’s Due Process Clause. And in Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14, 100 S. Ct.     1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1980), the Court held that the Eighth Amendment provides a damages remedy to a prisoner who died as a result of prison official’s deliberate indifference to his medical needs, in violation    of the Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.

It is by now well established that federal law provides damages actions at least in similar contexts, where claims of constitutional violation arise. Congress has ratified Bivens actions, plaintiffs frequently bring them, courts accept them, and scholars defend their importance. See J. Pfander, Constitutional Torts and the War on Terror (2017) (canvassing the history of Bivens and cataloguing cases). Moreover, the courts, in order to avoid deterring federal officials from properly performing their work, have developed safeguards for defendants, including the requirement that plaintiffs plead “plausible” claims, Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662, 679, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009), as well as the defense of “qualified immunity,” which frees federal officials from both threat of liability and involvement in the lawsuit, unless the plaintiffs establish that officials have violated “‘clearly established . . . constitutional rights,’” id., at 672, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1982)). “[This] Court has been reluctant to extend Bivens liability ‘to any new context or new category of defendants.’” Iqbal, supra, at 675, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (quoting    Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 68, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456 (2001)). But the Court has made clear that it would not narrow Bivens’ existing scope. See FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 485, 114 S. Ct. 996, 127 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1994) (guarding against “the    evisceration of the Bivens remedy” so that its “deterrent effects . . . would [not] be lost”).

The plaintiffs before us today seek damages for unconstitutional conditions of confinement. They alleged that federal officials slammed them against walls, shackled them, exposed them to nonstop lighting, lack of hygiene, and the like, all based upon invidious discrimination and without penological justification. See ante, at ___ - ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 304-305. In my view, these claims are well-pleaded, state violations of clearly established law, and fall within the scope of longstanding Bivens law. For those reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I shall discuss at some length what I believe is the most important point of disagreement. The Court, in my view, is wrong to hold that permitting a constitutional tort action here would “extend” Bivens, applying it in a new context. To the contrary, I fear that the Court’s holding would significantly shrink the existing Bivens contexts, diminishing the compensatory remedy constitutional tort law now offers to harmed individuals.

I shall explain why I believe this suit falls well within the scope of traditional constitutional tort law and why I cannot agree    with the Court’s arguments to the contrary. I recognize, and write separately about, the strongest of the Court’s arguments, namely, the fact that plaintiffs’ claims concern detention that took place soon after a serious attack on the United States and some of them concern actions of high-level Government officials. While these facts may affect     the substantive constitutional questions (e.g., were any of the conditions “legitimate”?) or the scope of the qualified-immunity defense, they do not extinguish the Bivens action itself. If I may paraphrase Justice Harlan, concurring in Bivens: In wartime as well as in peacetime, “it is important, in a civilized society, that the judicial branch of the Nation’s government stand ready to afford a remedy” “for the most flagrant and patently unjustified,” unconstitutional “abuses of official power.” 403 U. S., at 410-411, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (opinion concurring in judgment); cf. Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U. S. 723, 798, 128 S. Ct. 2229, 171 L. Ed. 2d 41 (2008).



I
The majority opinion well summarizes the particular claims that the plaintiffs make in this suit. All concern the conditions of their confinement, which began soon after the September 11, 2001, attacks and “lasted for days and weeks, then stretching into months.” Ante, at ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 302. At some point, the plaintiffs allege,    all the defendants knew that they had nothing to do with the September 11 attacks but continued to detain them anyway in harsh conditions. Official Government policy, both before and after the defendants became aware of the plaintiffs’ innocence, led to the plaintiffs being held in “tiny cells for over 23 hours a day” with lights continuously left on, “shackled” when moved, often “strip searched,” and “denied access to most forms of communication with the outside world.” Ante, at ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 304 (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendants detained the plaintiffs in these conditions on the basis of their race or religion and without justification.

Moreover, the prison wardens were aware of, but deliberately indifferent to, certain unofficial activities of prison guards involving a pattern of “physical and verbal abuse,” such as “slam[ming] detainees into walls; twist[ing] their arms, wrists, and     fingers; [breaking] their bones;” and subjecting them to verbal taunts. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).

The plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that all the defendants—high-level Department of Justice officials and prison wardens alike—were directly responsible for the official confinement policy, which, in some or    all of the aspects mentioned, violated the due process and equal protection components of the Fifth Amendment. The complaint adds that, insofar as the prison wardens were deliberately indifferent to the unofficial conduct of the guards, they violated the Fourth and the Fifth Amendments.

I would hold that the complaint properly alleges constitutional torts, i.e., Bivens actions for damages.



A
The Court’s holdings in Bivens, Carlson, and Davis rest upon four basic legal considerations. First, the Bivens Court referred to longstanding Supreme Court precedent stating or suggesting that the Constitution provides federal courts with considerable legal authority to use traditional remedies to right constitutional wrongs. That precedent begins with Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 1 Cranch 137, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803), which effectively placed upon those who would deny the existence of an effective legal remedy the burden     of showing why their case was special. Chief Justice John Marshall wrote for the Court that

“[t]he very essence of civil liberty [lies] in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury.” Id., at 163.

The Chief Justice referred to Blackstone’s Commentaries stating that there

“‘is a general and indisputable rule, that where there is a legal    right, there is also a legal remedy . . . [and that] it is a settled and invariable principle in the laws of England, that every right, when withheld, must have a remedy, and every injury its proper redress.’” 1 Cranch, at 163.

The Chief Justice then wrote:

“The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men. It will [not] deserve this high appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right.” Ibid.

He concluded for the Court that there must be something “peculiar” (i.e., special) about a case that warrants “exclu[ding] the injured party from legal redress . . . [and placing it within] that class of cases which come under the description of damnum absque injuria—a loss without an injury.” Id., at 163-164; but cf. id., at 164 (placing “political” questions in the latter, special category).

Much later, in Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684, 66 S. Ct. 773, 90 L. Ed. 939 (1946), the Court wrote that,

“where federally protected rights have been invaded, it has been the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief.”

See also Bivens, 403 U. S., at 392, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (citing opinions of Justices Cardozo and Holmes to similar effect).

The Bivens Court reiterated these principles and confirmed that the appropriate    remedial “adjust[ment]” in the case before it was an award of money damages, the “remedial mechanism normally available in the federal courts.” Id., at 392, 397, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619. Justice Harlan agreed, adding that, since Congress’ “general” statutory “grant of jurisdiction” authorized courts to grant equitable relief in cases arising under federal jurisdiction, courts likewise had the authority to award damages—the “traditional remedy at law”—in order to “vindicate the interests of the individual”     protected by the Bill of Rights. Id., at 405-407, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (opinion concurring in judgment).

Second, our cases have recognized that Congress’ silence on the subject indicates a willingness to leave this matter to the courts. In Bivens, the Court noted, as an argument favoring its conclusion, the absence of an “explicit congressional declaration that persons injured by a federal officer’s violation of the Fourth Amendment may not recover money damages from the agents.” Id., at 397, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619. Similarly, in Davis v. Passman, the Court stressed that there was “no evidence . . . that Congress meant . . . to foreclose” a damages remedy. 442 U. S., at 247, 99 S. Ct.     2264, 60 L. Ed. 2d 846. In Carlson, the Court went further, observing that not only was there no sign “that Congress meant to pre-empt a Bivens remedy,” but there was also “clear” evidence that    Congress intended to preserve it. 446 U. S., at 19-20, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15.

Third, our Bivens cases acknowledge that a constitutional tort may not lie when “special factors counse[l] hesitation” and when Congress has provided an adequate alternative remedy. 446 U. S., at 18-19, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619. The relevant special factors in those cases included whether the court was faced “with a question of ‘federal fiscal policy,’” Bivens, supra, at 396, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619, or a risk of “deluging federal courts with claims,” Davis, supra, at 248, 99 S. Ct. 2264, 60 L. Ed. 2d 846 (internal quotation marks omitted). Carlson acknowledged an additional factor—that damages suits “might inhibit [federal officials’] efforts to perform their official duties”—but concluded that “the qualified immunity accorded [federal officials] under [existing law] provides adequate protection.” 446 U. S., at 19, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15.

Fourth, as the Court recognized later in Carlson, a Bivens remedy was needed to cure what would, without it, amount to a constitutional anomaly. Long before this Court incorporated many of the Bill of Rights’ guarantees against the States, see Amar, The Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment, 101 Yale L. J. 1193 (1992), federal civil rights statutes afforded a damages remedy to any person whom a state official deprived of a federal constitutional right, see 42 U. S. C. §1983; Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 171-187, 81 S. Ct. 473, 5 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1961) (describing this history). But federal statutory law did not provide a damages remedy to a    person whom a federal official had deprived of that same right, even though the Bill of Rights was at the time of the founding primarily aimed at constraining the Federal Government. Thus, a person harmed by an unconstitutional search or seizure might sue a city mayor, a state legislator, or even a Governor. But that person could not sue a federal agent, a national legislator, or a Justice Department official for an identical offense. “[Our] ‘constitutional design,’” the Court wrote, “would be stood on its head if federal officials did not face at least the same liability as state officials guilty of the same constitutional transgression.” Carlson, supra, at 22, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15 (quoting Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 504, 98 S. Ct. 2894, 57 L. Ed. 2d 895 (1978)).

The Bivens Court also recognized that the Court had previously inferred damages remedies caused by violations of certain federal statutes that themselves did not explicitly authorize damages remedies. 403 U. S., at 395-396, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619. At the same time, Bivens, Davis, and Carlson treat the courts’ power to derive a damages remedy from a constitutional provision not as included within a power to find a statute-based damages remedy but as flowing from those statutory cases a fortiori.

    As the majority opinion points out, this Court in more recent years has indicated that    “expanding the Bivens remedy is now a ‘disfavored’ judicial activity.” Ante, at ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 308 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U. S., at 675, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d     868; emphasis added). Thus, it has held that the remedy is not available in the context of suits against military officers, see Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U. S. 296, 298-300, 103 S. Ct. 2362, 76 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1983); United States v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669, 683-684, 107 S. Ct. 3054, 97 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1987); in the context of suits against privately operated prisons and their employees, see Minneci v. Pollard, 565 U. S. 118, 120, 132 S. Ct. 617, 181 L. Ed. 2d 606 (2012); Malesko, 534 U. S., at 70-73, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456; in the context of suits seeking to vindicate procedural, rather than substantive, constitutional protections, see Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U. S. 412, 423, 108 S. Ct. 2460, 101 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1988); and in the context of suits seeking to vindicate two quite different forms of important substantive protection, one involving free speech, see Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367, 368, 103 S. Ct. 2404, 76 L. Ed. 2d 648 (1983), and the other involving protection of land rights, see Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U. S. 537, 551, 127 S. Ct. 2588, 168 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2007). Each of these cases involved a context that differed from that of Bivens, Davis, and Carlson with respect to the kind of defendant, the basic nature of the right, or the kind of harm suffered. That is to say, as we have explicitly stated, these cases were “fundamentally different from anything recognized in Bivens or subsequent cases.” Malesko, supra, at 70, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456 (emphasis added). In each of them, the plaintiffs were asking the Court to “‘authoriz[e] a new kind of federal litigation.’” Wilkie, supra, at 550, 127 S. Ct. 2588, 168 L. Ed. 2d 389 (emphasis added).

Thus the Court, as the majority opinion says, repeatedly wrote that it was not    “expanding” the scope of the Bivens remedy. Ante, at ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 308. But the Court nowhere suggested that it would narrow Bivens’ existing scope. In fact, to diminish any ambiguity about its holdings, the Court set out a framework for determining whether a claim of constitutional violation calls for a Bivens remedy. See Wilkie, supra, at 549-550, 127 S. Ct. 2588, 168 L. Ed. 2d 389. At Step One, the court must determine whether the case before it arises in a “new context,” that is, whether it involves a “new category of defendants,” Malesko, supra, at 68, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456, or (presumably) a significantly different kind of constitutional harm, such as a purely procedural harm, a harm to speech, or a harm caused to physical property. If the context is new, then the court proceeds to Step Two and asks “whether any alternative, existing process for protecting the interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages.” Wilkie, 551 U. S., at 550, 127 S. Ct. 2588, 168 L. Ed. 2d 389. If there is none, then the court proceeds to Step Three and asks whether there are “‘any special factors counselling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.’” Ibid.

Precedent makes this framework applicable here. I would apply it. And, doing so, I cannot get past    Step One. This suit, it seems to me, arises in a context similar to those in which this Court has previously permitted Bivens actions.



B

1
The context here is not “new,” Wilkie, supra, at 550, 127 S. Ct. 2588,     168 L. Ed. 2d 389, or “fundamentally different” than our previous Bivens cases, Malesko, supra, at 70, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456. First, the plaintiffs are civilians, not members of the military. They are not citizens, but the Constitution protects     noncitizens against serious mistreatment, as it protects citizens. See United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 271, 110 S. Ct. 1056, 108 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1990) (“[A]liens receive constitutional protections when they have come within the territory of the United States and developed substantial connections with this country”). Some or all of the plaintiffs here may have been illegally present in the United States. But that fact cannot justify physical mistreatment. Nor does anyone claim that that fact deprives them of a Bivens right available to other persons, citizens and noncitizens alike.

Second, the defendants are Government officials. They are not members of the military or private persons. Two are prison wardens. Three others are high-ranking Department of Justice officials. Prison wardens have been defendants in Bivens actions, as have other high-level Government officials. One of the defendants in Carlson    was the Director of the Bureau of Prisons; the defendant in Davis was a Member of Congress. We have also held that the Attorney General of the United States is not entitled to absolute immunity in a damages suit arising out of his actions related to national security. See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 520, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1985).

Third, from a Bivens perspective, the injuries that the plaintiffs claim they suffered are familiar ones. They focus upon the conditions of confinement. The plaintiffs say that they were unnecessarily shackled, confined in small unhygienic cells, subjected to continuous lighting (presumably preventing sleep), unnecessarily and frequently strip searched, slammed against walls, injured physically, and subject to verbal abuse. They allege that they suffered these harms because of their race or religion, the defendants having either turned a blind eye to what was happening or themselves introduced policies that they knew would lead to these harms even though the defendants knew the plaintiffs had no connections to terrorism.

These claimed harms are similar to, or even worse than, the harms the plaintiffs suffered in Bivens (unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment), Davis (unlawful discrimination in violation    of the Fifth Amendment), and Carlson (deliberate indifference to medical need in violation of the Eighth Amendment). Indeed, we have said that, “[i]f a federal prisoner in a [Bureau of Prisons] facility alleges a constitutional deprivation, he may bring a Bivens claim against the offending individual officer, subject to the defense of qualified immunity.” Malesko, 534 U. S., at 72, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456; see also Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 832, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994) (Bivens case about prisoner abuse). The claims in this suit would seem to fill the Bivens’ bill. See Sell v. United States, 539 U. S. 166, 193, 123 S. Ct. 2174, 156 L. Ed. 2d 197 (2003) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“[A] [Bivens] action . . . is available to federal pretrial detainees challenging the conditions of their confinement”).

It is true that the plaintiffs bring     their “deliberate indifference” claim against Warden Hasty under the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, not the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, as in Carlson. But that is because the latter applies to convicted criminals while the former applies to pretrial and immigration detainees. Where the harm is the same, where this Court has held that both the Fifth and Eighth Amendments give rise to Bivens’ remedies, and where the only difference in constitutional scope consists of a circumstance (the absence of a conviction) that makes the violation here worse, it cannot be maintained     that the difference between the use of the two Amendments is “fundamental.”    See City of Revere v. Massachusetts Gen. Hospital, 463 U. S. 239, 244, 103 S. Ct. 2979, 77 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1983) (“due process rights” of an unconvicted person “are at least as great as the Eighth Amendment protections available to a convicted prisoner”); Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U. S. ___, ___-___, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2475, 192 L. Ed. 2d 416, 428 (2015) ) (“pretrial detainees (unlike convicted prisoners) cannot be punished at all”); Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 721, 121 S. Ct. 2491, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653 (2001) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (detention “incident to removal . . . cannot be justified as punishment nor can the confinement or its conditions be designed in order to punish”). See also Bistrian v. Levi, 696 F. 3d 352, 372 (CA3 2012) (permitting Bivens action brought by detainee in administrative segregation); Thomas v. Ashcroft, 470 F. 3d 491, 493, 496-497 (CA2 2006) (detainee alleging failure to provide adequate medical care); Magluta v. Samples, 375 F. 3d 1269, 1271, 1275-1276 (CA11 2004) (detainee in solitary confinement); Papa v. United States, 281 F. 3d 1004, 1010-1011 (CA9 2002) (due process claims arising from death of immigration detainee); Loe v. Armistead, 582 F. 2d 1291, 1293-1296 (CA4 1978) (detainee’s claim of deliberate indifference to medical need). If an arrestee can bring a claim of excessive force (Bivens itself), and a convicted prisoner can bring a claim for denying medical care (Carlson), someone who has neither been charged nor convicted with a crime should also be able to challenge abuse that causes him to need medical care.

Nor has Congress suggested that it wants to withdraw a damages remedy in circumstances like these. By its express terms, the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) does not apply to immigration detainees.    See 42 U. S. C. §1997e(h) (“[T]he term ‘prisoner’ means any person incarcerated or detained in any facility who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law . . . ”); see also Agyeman v. INS, 296 F. 3d 871, 886 (CA9 2002) (“[W]e hold that an alien detained by the INS pending deportation is not a ‘prisoner’ within the meaning of the PLRA”); LaFontant v. INS, 135 F. 3d 158, 165, 328 U.S. App. D.C. 359 (CADC 1998) (same); Ojo v. INS, 106 F. 3d 680, 683 (CA5 1997) (same). And, in fact, there is strong evidence that Congress assumed that Bivens remedies would be available to prisoners when it enacted the PLRA—e.g., Congress continued to permit prisoners to recover for physical injuries, the typical kinds of Bivens injuries. See 28 U. S. C. §1346(b)(2); Pfander, Constitutional Torts, at 105-106.

If there were any lingering doubt that the claim against Warden Hasty     arises in a familiar Bivens context, the Court has made clear that conditions-of-confinement claims and medical-care claims are subject to the same substantive standard. See Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 8, 112 S. Ct. 995, 117 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1992) (“[Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294, 303, 111 S. Ct. 2321, 115 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1991)] extended the deliberate indifference standard applied to Eighth Amendment claims involving medical care to claims about conditions of confinement”). Indeed, the Court made this very point in a Bivens case alleging that prison wardens were deliberately indifferent to an inmate’s safety. See Farmer, supra, at 830, 834, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811.

I recognize that the Court finds a significant difference in the fact    that the confinement here arose soon after a national-security emergency, namely, the September 11 attacks. The short answer to this argument, in respect to at least some of the claimed harms, is that some plaintiffs continued to suffer those harms up to     eight months after the September 11 attacks took place and after the defendants knew the plaintiffs had no connection to terrorism. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15-1359, p. 280a. But because I believe the Court’s argument here is its strongest, I will consider it at greater length below. See Part III-C, infra.

Because the context here is not new, I would allow the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims to proceed. The plaintiffs have adequately alleged that the defendants were personally involved in imposing the conditions of confinement and did so with knowledge that the plaintiffs bore no ties to terrorism, thus satisfying Iqbal’s pleading standard. See 556 U. S., at 679, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (claims must be “plausible”); see also id., at 699-700, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (Breyer, J., dissenting). And because it is clearly established that it is unconstitutional to subject detainees to punitive conditions of confinement and to target them based solely on their race, religion, or national origin, the defendants    are not entitled to qualified immunity on the constitutional claims. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 535-539, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447, and n. 20 (1979); Davis, 442 U. S., at 236, 99 S. Ct. 2264, 60 L. Ed. 2d 846 (“It is equally clear . . . that the Fifth Amendment confers on petitioner a constitutional right to be free from illegal discrimination”). (Similarly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to the plaintiffs’ statutory claim, namely, that the defendants conspired to deprive the plaintiffs of equal protection of the laws in violation of 42 U. S. C. §1985(3). See Turkmen v. Hasty, 789 F. 3d 218, 262-264 (CA2 2015). I agree with the Court of Appeals that the defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity on this claim. See ibid.)

Even were I wrong and were the context here “fundamentally different,” Malesko, 534 U. S., at 70, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456, the plaintiffs’ claims would nonetheless survive Step Two and Step Three of the Court’s framework for determining whether Bivens applies, see supra, at ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 330. Step Two consists of asking whether “any alternative, existing process for protecting the interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages.” Wilkie,    551 U. S., at 550, 127 S. Ct. 2588, 168 L. Ed. 2d 389. I can find no such “alternative, existing process” here.

The Court does not claim that the PLRA provides plaintiffs with a remedy. Ante, at ___ - ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 317-318. Rather, it says that the plaintiffs may have “had    available to them” relief in the form of a prospective injunction or an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Ante, at ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 315. Neither a prospective injunction nor a writ of habeas corpus, however, will normally provide plaintiffs with redress for harms they have already suffered. And here plaintiffs make a strong claim that neither was available to them—at least not for a considerable time. Some of the plaintiffs allege that for two or three months they were subject to a “communications blackout”; that the prison “staff did not permit them visitors, legal or social telephone calls, or mail”; that their families and attorneys did not know where they were being held; that they could not receive visits from their attorneys; that subsequently their lawyers could call them only once a week; and that some or all of the defendants “interfered with the detainees’ effective access to legal counsel.” Office of Inspector General (OIG) Report, App. 223, 293, 251, 391; see App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15-1359, at 253a (incorporating the OIG report into the complaint). These claims make it virtually impossible to say that here there is an “elaborate, comprehensive” alternative remedial scheme similar    to schemes that,     in the past, we have found block the application of Bivens to new contexts. Bush, 462 U. S., at 385, 103 S. Ct. 2404, 76 L. Ed. 2d 648. If these allegations are proved, then in this suit, it is “damages or nothing.” Bivens, 403 U. S., at 410, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment).

There being no “alternative, existing process” that provides a “convincing reason” for not applying Bivens, we must proceed to Step Three. Wilkie, supra, at 550, 127 S. Ct. 2588, 168 L. Ed. 2d 389. Doing so, I can find no “special factors [that] counse[l] hesitation before authorizing” this Bivens action. 551 U. S., at 550, 127 S. Ct. 2588, 168 L. Ed. 2d 389. I turn to this matter next.



II

A
The Court describes two general considerations that it believes argue against an “extension” of Bivens. First, the majority opinion points out that the Court is now far less likely than at the time it decided Bivens to imply a cause of action for damages from a statute that does not explicitly provide for a damages claim. See ante, at ___ - ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 307. Second, it finds the “silence” of Congress “notable” in that Congress, though likely aware of the “high-level policies” involved in this suit, did not “choose to extend to any person the kind of remedies” that the plaintiffs here “seek.” Ante, at ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 314 (internal quotation marks omitted). I doubt the strength of these two general considerations.

The first consideration,    in my view, is not relevant. I concede that the majority and concurring opinions in Bivens looked in part for support to the fact that the Court had implied damages remedies from statutes silent on the subject. See 403 U. S., at 397, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619;     id., at 402-403, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment). But that was not the main argument favoring the Court’s conclusion. Rather, the Court drew far stronger support from the need for such a remedy when measured against a common-law and constitutional history of allowing traditional legal remedies where necessary. Id., at 392, 396-397, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619. The Court believed such a remedy was necessary to make effective the Constitution’s protection of certain basic individual rights. See id., at 392, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619; id., at 407, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (opinion of Harlan, J.). Similarly, as the Court later explained, a damages remedy against federal officials prevented the serious legal anomaly I previously mentioned. Its existence made basic constitutional protections of the individual against Federal Government abuse (the Bill of Rights’ pre-Civil War objective) as effective as protections against abuse by state officials (the post-Civil War, post selective-incorporation objective). See supra, at ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 329.

Nor is the second circumstance—congressional silence—relevant in the manner that the majority    opinion describes. The Court initially saw that silence as indicating an absence of congressional hostility to the Court’s exercise of its traditional remedy-inferring powers. See Bivens, supra, at 397, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619; Davis, 442 U. S., at 246-247, 99 S. Ct. 2264, 60 L. Ed. 2d 846. Congress’ subsequent silence contains strong signs that it accepted Bivens actions as part of the law. After all, Congress rejected a proposal that would have eliminated Bivens by substituting the U. S. Government as a defendant in suits against federal officers that raised constitutional claims. See Pfander, Constitutional Torts, at 102. Later, Congress expressly immunized federal employees acting in the course of their official duties from tort claims except those premised on violations of the Constitution. See Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, commonly known as the Westfall Act, 28 U. S. C. §2679(b)(2)(A).     We stated that it is consequently “crystal clear that Congress views [the Federal Tort Claims Act] and Bivens as [providing] parallel, complementary causes of action.” Carlson, 446 U. S., at 20, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15; see Malesko, 534 U. S., at 68, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456 (similar). Congress has even assumed the existence of a Bivens remedy in suits brought by noncitizen detainees suspected of terrorism. See 42 U. S. C. §2000dd-1 (granting qualified immunity—but not absolute immunity—to military and civilian federal officials    who are sued by alien detainees suspected of terrorism).



B
The majority opinion also sets forth a more specific list of factors that it says bear on “whether a case presents a new Bivens context.” Ante, at ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 311. In the Court’s view, a “case might differ” from Bivens “in a meaningful way because of [1] the rank of the officers involved; [2] the constitutional right at issue; [3] the generality or specificity of the individual action; [4] the extent of judicial guidance as to how an officer should respond to the problem or emergency to be confronted; [5] the statutory or other legal mandate under which the officer was operating;     [6] the risk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into the functioning of other branches; [7] or the presence of potential special factors that previous Bivens cases did not consider.” Ante, at ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 311. In my view, these factors do not make a “meaningful difference” at Step One of the Bivens framework. Some of them are better cast as “special factors” relevant to Step Three. But, as I see it, none should normally foreclose a Bivens action and none is determinative here. Consider them one by one:

(1) The rank of the officers. I can understand why an officer’s rank    might bear on whether he violated the Constitution, because, for example, a plaintiff might need to show the officer was willfully blind to a harm caused by lower ranking officers or that the officer had actual knowledge of the misconduct. And I can understand that rank might relate to the existence of a legal defense, such as qualified, or even absolute, immunity. But if—and I recognize that this is often a very big if—a plaintiff proves a clear constitutional violation, say, of the Fourth Amendment, and he shows that the defendant does not possess any form of immunity or other defense, then why should he not have a damages remedy for harm suffered? What does rank have to do with that question, namely, the Bivens question? Why should the law treat differently a high-level official and the local constable where each has similarly violated the Constitution and where neither can successfully assert immunity or any other defense?

(2) The constitutional right at issue. I agree that this factor can make a difference, but only when the substance of the right is distinct. See, e.g., Wilkie, 551 U. S. 537, 127 S. Ct. 2588, 168 L. Ed. 2d 389 (land rights). But, for reasons I have already pointed out, there is no relevant difference between the rights at issue here    and the rights at issue in our previous Bivens cases, namely, the rights to be free of unreasonable searches, invidious discrimination, and physical abuse in federal custody. See supra, at ___ - ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 331.

(3) The generality or specificity of the individual action. I should think that it is not the “generality or specificity” of an official action but rather the nature of the official action that matters. Bivens should apply to some generally applicable actions, such as actions taken deliberately to jail a large group of known-innocent people. And it should not apply to some highly     specific actions, depending upon the nature of those actions.

(4) The extent of judicial guidance. This factor may be relevant to the existence of a constitutional violation or a qualified-immunity defense. Where judicial guidance is lacking, it is more likely that a constitutional violation is not clearly established. See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640, 107 S. Ct. 3034, 97 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1987) (Officials are protected by qualified immunity unless “[t]he contours of the right [are] sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right”). But I do not see how, assuming the violation is clear, the presence or absence of “judicial guidance” is relevant    to the existence of a damages remedy.

(5) The statutory (or other) legal mandate under which the officer was operating. This factor too may prove     relevant to the question whether a constitutional violation exists or is clearly established. But, again, assuming that it is, I do not understand why this factor is relevant to the existence of a damages remedy. See Stanley, 483 U. S., at 684, 107 S. Ct. 3054, 97 L. Ed. 2d 550 (the question of immunity is “analytically distinct” from the question whether a Bivens action should lie).

(6) Risk of disruptive judicial intrusion. All damages actions risk disrupting to some degree future decisionmaking by members of the Executive or Legislative Branches. Where this Court has authorized Bivens actions, it has found that disruption tolerable, and it has explained why disruption is, from a constitutional perspective, desirable. See Davis, 442 U. S., at 242, 99 S. Ct. 2264, 60 L. Ed. 2d 846 (Unless constitutional rights “are to become merely precatory, . . . litigants who allege that their own constitutional rights have been violated, and who at the same time have no effective means other than the judiciary to enforce these rights, must be able to invoke the existing jurisdiction of the courts for . . . protection”); Malesko, supra, at 70, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456 (“The purpose of Bivens is to deter    individual federal officers from committing constitutional violations”). Insofar as the Court means this consideration to provide a reason why there should be no Bivens action where a Government employee acts in time of security need, I shall discuss the matter next, in Part C.

(7) Other potential special factors. Since I am not certain what these other “potential factors” are and, since the Court does not specify their nature, I would not, and the Court cannot, consider them in differentiating this suit from our previous Bivens cases or as militating against recognizing a Bivens action here.



C
In my view, the Court’s strongest argument is that Bivens should not apply to policy-related actions taken in times of national-security need, for example, during war or national-security emergency. As the Court correctly points out, the Constitution grants primary power to protect the Nation’s security to the Executive and Legislative Branches, not to the Judiciary. But the Constitution also delegates to the Judiciary the duty to protect an individual’s fundamental constitutional rights. Hence when protection of those rights and a determination of security needs conflict, the Court has a role    to play. The Court most recently made this clear in cases arising out of the detention of enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay. Justice O’Connor wrote that “a state of war is not a blank check.” Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 536, 124 S. Ct. 2633, 159 L. Ed. 2d 578 (2004) (plurality opinion). In Boumediene, 553 U. S., at 732-733, 128 S. Ct. 2229, 171 L. Ed. 2d 41, the Court reinforced that point, holding that noncitizens detained as enemy combatants     were entitled to challenge their detention through a writ of habeas corpus, notwithstanding the national-security concerns at stake.

We have not, however, answered the specific question the Court places at issue here: Should Bivens actions continue to exist in respect to policy-related actions taken in time of war or national emergency? In my view, they should.

For one thing, a Bivens action comes     accompanied by many legal safeguards designed to prevent the courts from interfering with Executive and Legislative Branch activity reasonably believed to be necessary to protect national security. In Justice Jackson’s well-known words, the Constitution is not “a suicide pact.” Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 37, 69 S. Ct. 894, 93 L. Ed. 1131 (1949) (dissenting opinion). The Constitution itself takes account of public necessity. Thus, for example, the Fourth Amendment does not forbid all Government searches and seizures; it forbids only those that are “unreasonable.” Ordinarily,    it requires that a police officer obtain a search warrant before entering an apartment, but should the officer observe a woman being dragged against her will into that apartment, he should, and will, act at once. The Fourth Amendment makes allowances for such “exigent circumstances.” Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 401, 126 S. Ct. 1943, 164 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2006) (warrantless entry justified to forestall imminent injury). Similarly, the Fifth Amendment bars only conditions of confinement that are not “reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective.” Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S., at 539, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447. What is unreasonable and illegitimate in time of peace may be reasonable and legitimate in time of war.

Moreover, Bivens comes accompanied with a qualified-immunity defense. Federal officials will face suit only if they have violated a constitutional right that was “clearly established” at the time they acted. Harlow, 457 U. S., at 818, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396.

Further, in order to prevent the very presence of a Bivens lawsuit from interfering with the work of a Government official, this Court has held that a complaint must state a claim for relief that is “plausible.” Iqbal, 556 U. S., at 679, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868. “[C]onclusory” statements and “[t]hreadbare” allegations will not suffice. Id., at 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868. And the Court has protected high-level officials in particular by requiring that plaintiffs plead that an official was personally involved in the unconstitutional    conduct; an official cannot be vicariously liable for another’s misdeeds. Id., at 676, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868.

Finally, where such a claim is filed, courts can, and should, tailor discovery orders so that they do not unnecessarily or improperly interfere with the official’s work. The Second Circuit has emphasized the “need to vindicate the purpose of the qualified immunity defense by dismissing non-meritorious claims against public officials at an early stage of litigation.” Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F. 3d 143, 158 (2007). Where some of the defendants are “current or former senior officials of the Government, against whom broad-ranging allegations of knowledge and personal involvement are easily made, a district court” not only “may, but ‘must exercise its discretion in a way that protects the substance of the qualified immunity defense . . . so that’” those officials “‘are not subjected to unnecessary and burdensome discovery or trial proceedings.’” Id., at 158-159. The court can make “all such discovery subject to prior court approval.” Id., at 158. It can “structure . . . limited discovery by examining written responses to interrogatories and requests to admit before authorizing     depositions, and by deferring discovery directed to high-    level officials until discovery of front-line    officials has been completed and has demonstrated the need for discovery higher up the ranks.” Ibid. In a word, a trial court can and should so structure the proceedings with full recognition that qualified immunity amounts to immunity from suit as well as immunity from liability.

Given these safeguards against undue interference by the Judiciary in times of war or national-security emergency, the Court’s abolition, or limitation of, Bivens actions goes too far. If you are cold, put on a sweater, perhaps an overcoat, perhaps also turn up the heat, but do not set fire to the house.

At the same time, there may well be a particular need for Bivens remedies when security-related Government actions are at issue. History tells us of far too many instances where the Executive or Legislative Branch took actions during time of war that, on later examination, turned out unnecessarily and unreasonably to have deprived American citizens of basic constitutional rights. We have read about the Alien and Sedition Acts, the thousands of civilians imprisoned during the Civil War, and the suppression of civil liberties during World War I. See W. Rehnquist, All the Laws but One: Civil Liberties in Wartime    209-210, 49-50, 173-180, 183 (1998); see also Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2, 4 Wall. 2, 18 L. Ed. 281 (1866) (decided after the Civil War was over). The pages of the U. S. Reports themselves recite this Court’s refusal to set aside the Government’s World War II action removing more than 70,000 American citizens of Japanese origin from their west coast homes and interning them in camps, see Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214, 65 S. Ct. 193, 89 L. Ed. 194 (1944)an action that at least some officials knew at the time was unnecessary, see id., at 233-242, 65 S. Ct. 193, 89 L. Ed. 194 (Murphy, J., dissenting); P. Irons, Justice at War 202-204, 288 (1983). President Franklin Roosevelt’s Attorney General, perhaps exaggerating, once said that “[t]he Constitution has not greatly bothered any wartime President.” Rehnquist, supra, at 191.

Can we, in respect to actions taken during those periods, rely exclusively, as the Court seems to suggest, upon injunctive remedies or writs of habeas corpus, their retail equivalent? Complaints seeking that kind of relief typically come during the emergency itself, when emotions are strong, when courts may have too little or inaccurate information, and when courts may well prove particularly reluctant to interfere with even the least well-founded Executive Branch activity. That reluctance may itself set an unfortunate precedent, which, as Justice Jackson pointed    out, can “li[e] about like a loaded weapon” awaiting discharge in another case. Korematsu, supra, at 246, 65 S. Ct. 193, 89 L. Ed. 194 (dissenting opinion).

A damages action, however, is typically brought after the emergency is over, after emotions have cooled, and at a time when more factual information is available. In such circumstances, courts have more time to exercise such judicial virtues as calm reflection and dispassionate application of the law to the facts. We have applied the Constitution to actions taken during periods of war and national-security emergency. See Boumediene, 553 U. S., at 732-733, 128 S. Ct. 2229, 171 L. Ed. 2d 41; Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 124    S. Ct. 2633, 159 L. Ed. 2d 578; cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 72 S. Ct. 863, 96 L. Ed. 1153, 62 Ohio Law Abs. 417 (1952). I should think that the wisdom of permitting courts to consider Bivens actions, later granting monetary compensation to those wronged at the time, would follow a fortiori.

    As is well known, Lord Atkins, a British judge, wrote in the midst of World War II that “amid the clash of arms, the laws are not silent. They may be changed, but they speak the same language in war as in peace.” Liversidge v. Anderson, [1942] A. C. 206 (H. L. 1941) 244. The Court, in my view, should say the same of this Bivens action.

With respect, I dissent.
