
I write separately to make two observations.

    First, as the Court has observed, Congress designed the Tax Injunction Act not “to prevent federal-court interference with all aspects of state tax administration,” Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 105, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted), but more modestly to stop litigants from using federal courts to circumvent States’ “pay without delay, then sue for a    refund” regimes. See id., at 104-105, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172 (“[I]n enacting the [Tax Injunction Act], Congress trained its attention on taxpayers who sought to avoid paying their tax bill by pursuing a challenge route other than the one specified by the taxing authority.”). This suit does not implicate that congressional objective. The Direct Marketing Association is not challenging its own or anyone else’s tax liability or tax collection responsibilities. And the claim is not one likely to be pursued in a state refund action. A different question would be posed, however, by a suit to enjoin reporting obligations imposed on a taxpayer or tax collector, e.g., an employer or an in-state retailer, litigation in lieu of a direct challenge to an “assessment,” “levy,” or “collection.” The Court does not reach today the question whether the claims in such a suit, i.e., claims suitable for a refund action, are barred by the Tax Injunction Act. On that understanding, I join the Court’s opinion.

Second, the Court’s decision in this case, I emphasize, is entirely consistent with our decision in Hibbs. The plaintiffs in Hibbs sought to enjoin certain state tax credits. That suit, like the action here, did not directly challenge “acts    of assessment, levy, and collection themselves,” ante, at ___, 191 L. Ed. 2d, at 106. See Hibbs, 542 U. S., at 96, 99-102, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172. Moreover, far from threatening to deplete the State’s coffers, “the relief requested [in Hibbs] would [have] result[ed] in the state’s receiving more funds that could be used for the public benefit.”     Id., at 96, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). Even a suit that somewhat “inhibits” “assessment, levy, or collection,” the Court holds today, falls outside the scope of the Tax Injunction Act. Ante, at ___, 191 L. Ed. 2d, at 108. That holding casts no shadow on Hibbs’ conclusion that a suit further removed from the Act’s “state-revenue-protective moorings,” 542 U. S., at 106, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172, remains outside the Act’s scope.
