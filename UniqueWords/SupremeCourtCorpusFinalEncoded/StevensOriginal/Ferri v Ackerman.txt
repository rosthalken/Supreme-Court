[*194]  [***357]  [**404]  MR. JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.

LEdHN[1A] [1A]The question is whether an attorney appointed by a federal judge to represent an indigent defendant in a federal criminal trial is, as a matter of federal law, entitled to absolute immunity in a state malpractice suit brought against him  [****4]  by his former client.

On August 28, 1974, a federal  [***358]  grand jury for the Western District of Pennsylvania named petitioner as a defendant in five counts of a nine-count federal indictment alleging that he had participated in a 1971 conspiracy to construct and use a bomb in violation of various federal statutes. 1Link to the text of the note In due course, the District Court appointed respondent to serve as petitioner's counsel pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act of 1964. 2Link to the text of the note [****5]  Respondent represented petitioner during pretrial proceedings  [*195]  and a 12-day trial. The jury found petitioner guilty on all counts; the judge imposed a sentence of 20 years on the conspiracy and bombing counts and an additional 10 years on the counts charging violations of the Internal Revenue Code. The judgments of conviction were affirmed summarily by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 3Link to the text of the note

While that appeal was pending, on March 4, 1976, petitioner filed a "complaint in negligence" against respondent in the Court of Common Pleas for Union County, Pa. 4Link to the text of the note The  [**405]  complaint described 67 different instances of alleged malpractice in respondent's conduct of the federal criminal trial and prayed for the recovery of substantial pecuniary damages. 5Link to the text of the note Respondent filed a demurrer, asserting that the complaint failed to state a cause of action and that respondent was immune from any civil liability arising out of his conduct of petitioner's defense.

 [****6]  Petitioner thereafter filed a "Traversal Brief" in which he argued that the sufficiency of the malpractice complaint was supported by various sections of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure and the Pennsylvania Constitution. 6Link to the text of the note In that brief petitioner added a claim that respondent had negligently  [*196]  failed to plead the statute of limitations as a bar to the Internal Revenue Code counts of the indictment. 7Link to the text of the note

 [****7]  Without  [***359]  ruling on its sufficiency, the Court of Common Pleas, sitting en banc, dismissed the complaint on the ground that decided cases and strong public policy required that a lawyer appointed to represent an indigent defendant in a federal trial must be immune from liability for damages. The court cited one Pennsylvania case 8Link to the text of the note but relied primarily on federal authorities for its conclusion. 9Link to the text of the note By a divided vote, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal, squarely resting its decision on federal law.

 [****8]  Because the case concerned a claim of immunity by a participant in a federal proceeding, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court believed that it was required to look to federal law to determine whether immunity exists and, if so, its nature and  [*197]  scope. 10Link to the text of the note After reviewing federal cases holding that the common-law doctrine of judicial immunity has been embraced in the federal system and encompasses prosecutors and grand jurors as well as judges, the court concluded  [**406]  that the justification for the immunity -- the concern that the threat of harassment by unfounded litigation might impair the public officer's performance of his official duties -- was equally applicable to defense counsel as participants in judicial proceedings. The court held that the privilege was absolute and therefore applied even to a claim of gross negligence and even though the allegation of malpractice did not concern an exercise of counsel's discretion.

 [****9]  The two dissenting justices agreed that federal law was applicable, but regarded appointed counsel as more analogous to privately retained counsel than to a federal officer such as a prosecutor. Because those who can afford to retain counsel of their own choosing have a remedy for malpractice, the dissenters felt that the denial of a comparable remedy for the indigent would establish a lower standard of care for appointed counsel. 

LEdHN[2] [2]The narrow issue presented to this Court is whether federal law in any way pre-empts the freedom of a State to decide the question of immunity in this situation in accord with its own law. We are not concerned  [***360]  with the elements of a state cause of action for malpractice and need not speculate about  [*198]  whether a state court would consider petitioner's allegations sufficient to establish a breach of duty or a right to recover damages. 11Link to the text of the note Nor are we concerned with the question whether Pennsylvania may conclude as a matter of state law that respondent is absolutely immune. 12Link to the text of the note For HN1 when state law creates a cause of action, the State is free to define the defenses to that claim, including the defense of immunity, unless, of course, the state [****10]  rule is in conflict with federal law. U.S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.



LEdHN[3A] [3A]For the purposes of our analysis, it is appropriate to assume that petitioner is entitled to prevail as a matter of state law, and to ask whether federal law requires a State to accept respondent's defense of absolute immunity. We may begin the inquiry by noting that there are separate federal interests that arguably could support the application of a separate federal rule in cases of this kind. A federal statute provided the basis for respondent's appointment and compensation, and he participated in a federal judicial proceeding as an "officer" of the federal court. The identification of those federal interests does not, however, demonstrate that an applicable federal rule of law has been adopted by Congress or recognized by this Court. 13Link to the text of the note We therefore  [****11]  must consider whether respondent's immunity claim is supported by (1) the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964 or (2) our cases considering the immunity of federal officers for the performance of their assigned duties. 

LEdHN[3B] [3B]

 [*199]  I

The Criminal Justice Act of 1964 was enacted to provide compensation for attorneys appointed to represent indigent defendants in federal criminal trials. 14Link to the text of the note [****13]  In response to evidence that unpaid appointed counsel were sometimes less  [****12]  diligent or less  [**407]  thorough than retained counsel, 15Link to the text of the note Congress concluded that reasonable compensation would improve the quality of the representation of indigents. Although it might well have been suggested that a statutory immunity would be helpful in inducing counsel to accept representation of indigent defendants, there is nothing in the  [***361]  statute itself or in its legislative history to indicate that Congress ever considered -- much less actually intended to implement -- any such suggestion. Indeed, Congress' attempt to minimize the differences between retained and appointed counsel 16Link to the text of the note [****14]  is  [*200]  more consistent with the view that Congress intended all defense counsel to satisfy the same standards of professional responsibility and to be subject to the same controls. 17Link to the text of the note

 [****15]  [*201]  [**408]  The  [***362]  fact that federal funds provided the source of respondent's compensation is not a sufficient basis for inferring that Congress intended to grant him immunity from malpractice suits. Countless private citizens are the recipients of federal funds of one kind or another, but Congress surely did not intend that all such recipients would be immune for actions taken in the course of expending those funds.

LEdHN[1B] [1B]In sum, we find HN2 nothing in the express language, the history, or the basic purpose of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964 to support the conclusion that Pennsylvania must accept respondent's claim of immunity from liability for a state tort.

 [*202]  II

Without relying on an explicit statutory grant of immunity, this Court has held that various federal officers, such as a captain in the United States Navy and the Postmaster General, 18Link to the text of the note are entitled to immunity from liability for certain claims arising out of the performance of their official duties. The immunity recognized in those cases may be appropriately characterized as an incident of the federal office.

 [****16]  In a sense, a lawyer who is appointed to represent an indigent defendant in a federal judicial proceeding is also a federal officer. Since other federal officers -- the judge, the prosecutor, and the grand jurors -- enjoy immunity by virtue of their office, arguably that immunity should be shared by appointed counsel. There is, however, a marked difference between the nature of counsel's responsibilities and those of other officers of the court. 19Link to the text of the note [****17]  As  [***363]  public servants, the prosecutor  [*203]  and the judge represent the interest of society as a whole. The conduct of their official duties may adversely affect a wide variety of different individuals, each of whom may be a potential source of future controversy. The societal interest in providing such public officials with the maximum ability to deal fearlessly and impartially with the public at large has long been recognized as an acceptable  [**409]  justification for official immunity. 20Link to the text of the note The point of immunity for such  [*204]  officials is to forestall an atmosphere of intimidation that would conflict with their resolve to perform their designated functions in a principled fashion.

 [****18]  LEdHN[1C] [1C]In contrast, the primary office performed by appointed counsel parallels the office of privately retained counsel. Although it is true that appointed counsel serves pursuant to statutory authorization and in furtherance of the federal interest in insuring effective representation of criminal defendants, his duty is not to the public at large, except in that general way. His principal responsibility is to serve the undivided interests of his client. Indeed, an indispensable element of the effective performance of his responsibilities is the ability to act independently of the Government and to oppose it in adversary litigation. The fear that an unsuccessful defense of a criminal charge will lead to a malpractice claim does not conflict with performance of that function. If anything, it provides the same incentive for appointed and retained counsel to perform that function competently. 21Link to the text of the note [****19]  The primary rationale for granting immunity to judges, prosecutors, and other public officers does not apply  [***364]  to defense counsel sued for malpractice by his own client. 22Link to the text of the note

It may well be true, as respondent argues, that valid policy reasons might justify an immunity for appointed counsel that need not be accorded to privately retained counsel. See n. 17, supra. Perhaps the most persuasive reason for creating such an immunity would be to make sure that competent  [*205]  counsel remain willing to accept the work of representing indigent defendants. If their monetary compensation is significantly less than that of retained counsel, and if the burden of defending groundless malpractice claims and charges of unprofessional conduct is disproportionately significant, it is conceivable that an immunity would be justified by the need to preserve the supply of lawyers available for this  [**410]  important work. Whether a sufficient need can be demonstrated that [****20]  would justify such a rule, or whether such a problem might be better remedied by adjusting the level of compensation, are questions that can most appropriately be answered by a legislative body acting on the basis of empirical data. Therefore we do not evaluate those arguments. Having concluded that HN3 the essential office of appointed defense counsel is akin to that of private counsel and unlike that of a prosecutor, judge, or naval captain, we also conclude that the federal officer immunity doctrine explicated in cases like Howard v. Lyons, 360 U.S. 593, and Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, is simply inapplicable in this case. Accordingly, without reaching any question concerning the power of Congress to create immunity, we hold that HN4 federal law does not now provide immunity for court-appointed counsel in a state malpractice suit brought by his former client.

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
