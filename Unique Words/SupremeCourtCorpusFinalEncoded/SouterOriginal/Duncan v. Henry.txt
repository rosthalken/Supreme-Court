WILLIAM DUNCAN, WARDEN v. ROBERT E. HENRY

No. 94-941

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

115 S. Ct. 887

January 23, 1995, Decided

JUSTICE SOUTER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG and JUSTICE BREYER join, concurring in the judgment.
I concur in the judgment because respondent's "miscarriage of justice" claim in state court was reasonably understood  [*367]  to raise a state-law issue of prejudice, not a federal issue of due process. Consequently, no federal claim was "fairly presented to the state courts" within the meaning of  [***869]  Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275, 30 L. Ed. 2d 438, 92 S. Ct. 509 (1971).
