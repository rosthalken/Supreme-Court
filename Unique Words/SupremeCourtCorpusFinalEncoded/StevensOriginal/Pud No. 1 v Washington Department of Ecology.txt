PUD NO. 1 OF JEFFERSON COUNTY AND CITY OF TACOMA, PETITIONERS v. WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF ECOLOGY, ET AL.

No. 92-1911 

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

511 U.S. 700

February 23, 1994, Argued 
May 31, 1994, Decided 

JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.
While I agree fully with the thorough analysis in the Court's opinion, I add this comment  [**1915]  for emphasis. For judges who find it unnecessary to go behind the statutory text to discern the intent of Congress, this is (or should be) an easy case. Not a single sentence, phrase, or word in the Clean Water Act purports to place any constraint on a State's power to regulate the quality of its own waters more stringently than federal law might require. In fact, the Act explicitly recognizes States' ability to impose stricter standards. See, e. g., § 301(b)(1)(C), 33 U.S.C. § 1311(b)(1)(C).
