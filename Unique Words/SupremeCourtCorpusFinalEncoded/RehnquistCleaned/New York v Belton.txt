
Because it is apparent that a majority of the Court is unwilling to overrule Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), and because the Court does not find it necessary to consider the “automobile exception” in its disposition of this case, ante, at 2865, n. 6, see Robbins v. California, 453 U.S. 420, 437, 101 S.Ct. 2841, 2851, 69 L.Ed.2d 744 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting), I join the opinion of the Court.
