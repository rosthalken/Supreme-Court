
For the reasons given in my dissent last Term in Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U.S. 265, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753 (1995), I remain of the view that § 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 2, does not apply to proceedings in state courts. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
