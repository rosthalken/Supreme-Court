Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice ALITO joins, dissenting.

I agree with the Court’s conclusion that there is no special exception to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6) for claim construction. But that is not the question in this case. Because Rule 52(a)(6) provides for clear error review only of “findings of fact” and “does not apply to conclusions of law,” Pullman–Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 287, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982), the question here is whether claim construction involves findings of fact.1 Because it does not, Rule 52(a)(6) does not apply, and the Court of Appeals properly applied a de novo standard of review.
 

I
In reaching the contrary conclusion, the majority fails to engage the “vexing ... distinction between questions of fact and questions of law.” Id., at 288, 102 S.Ct. 1781. Unfortunately, “Rule 52(a) does not furnish particular guidance with respect to distinguishing law from fact,” and we have found it difficult to discern “any other rule or principle that will unerringly” differentiate the two. Ibid. That inquiry is thus not as simple as pointing out the undeniable *845 “evidentiary underpinnings” of claim construction. Ante, at 840 – 841.
 
Instead, we must consider how “findings of fact” and “conclusions of law” were understood at the time Rule 52 was adopted. Cf. Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150, 168, 115 S.Ct. 696, 130 L.Ed.2d 574 (1995) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (noting that, because the federal rules have their background in common-law principles, “the body of common law knowledge must be a source of guidance in our interpretation of the Rules” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Unfortunately, the pre–1937 evidence of this Court’s treatment of evidentiary determinations underlying claim construction is inconclusive. In several decisions, the Court considered extrinsic evidence related to claim construction with no apparent deference to the District Courts’ findings based on that evidence. Coupe v. Royer, 155 U.S. 565, 576, 15 S.Ct. 199, 39 L.Ed. 263 (1895); Loom Co. v. Higgins, 105 U.S. 580, 584–587, 26 L.Ed. 1177 (1882); Tilghman v. Proctor, 102 U.S. 707, 729–731, 26 L.Ed. 279 (1881); Winans v. Denmead, 15 How. 330, 339, 14 L.Ed. 717 (1854). None of those decisions, however, expressly turned on a disagreement over a subsidiary evidentiary determination.
 
Absent specific evidence of the treatment of a particular issue at the time Rule 52 was adopted, we have drawn analogies to the treatment of other issues under Rule 52(a)(6). See, e.g., Pullman, supra, at 288, 102 S.Ct. 1781. In general, we have treated district-court determinations as “analytically more akin to a fact” the more they pertain to a simple historical fact of the case, and as “analytically more akin to ... a legal conclusion” the more they define rules applicable beyond the parties’ dispute. Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.S. 104, 116, 106 S.Ct. 445, 88 L.Ed.2d 405 (1985); see also Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984); Baumgartner v. United States, 322 U.S. 665, 671, 64 S.Ct. 1240, 88 L.Ed. 1525 (1944). Under this approach, determinations underlying claim construction fall on the law side of the dividing line.
 

A
Patents are written instruments, so other written instruments supply the logical analogy. See Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 381, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996). And as the majority recognizes, the construction of written instruments is generally a question of law. See ante, at 837. But in certain contexts, a court construing a written instrument makes subsidiary determinations that the law treats as findings of fact.
 
The classic case of a written instrument whose construction does not involve subsidiary findings of fact is a statute. Our treatment of subsidiary evidentiary findings underlying statutory construction as conclusions of law makes sense for two reasons.
 
First, although statutory construction may demand some inquiry into legislative “intent,” that inquiry is analytically legal: The meaning of a statute does not turn on what an individual lawmaker intended as a matter of fact, but only on what intent has been enacted into law through the constitutionally defined channels of bicameralism and presentment. See Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 587, 129 S.Ct. 1187, 173 L.Ed.2d 51 (2009) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). This remains so even if deciding what passed through those channels requires a court to determine a “fact” of historical understanding through an examination of extrinsic evidence. See, e.g., *846 Sosa v. Alvarez–Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 714–715, 124 S.Ct. 2739, 159 L.Ed.2d 718 (2004) (examining the historical understanding of the term “law of nations” when the Alien Tort Statute was enacted); see also, e.g., McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U.S. 334, 359–366, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (construing a constitutional provision by asking how the words were originally understood and marshaling evidence of that understanding). The Court has given no hint that this practice changes when the statute it construes is a land patent—that is, a public land grant. See Leo Sheep Co. v. United States, 440 U.S. 668, 669, 99 S.Ct. 1403, 59 L.Ed.2d 677 (1979) (making detailed historical findings in the course of construing a land grant because “ ‘courts, in construing a statute, may with propriety recur to the history of the times when it was passed ... in order to ascertain the reason as well as the meaning of particular provisions in it’ ”); see also Marvin M. Brandt Revocable Trust v. United States, 572 U.S. ––––, ––––, 134 S.Ct. 1257, 1264–1265, 188 L.Ed.2d 272 (2014) (looking to the historical background against which a land grant was passed to confirm its interpretation).
 
Second, statutes govern the rights and duties of the public as a whole, so subsidiary evidentiary findings shape legal rules that apply far beyond the boundaries of the dispute involved. Our rules of construction for legislative acts have long been consciously shaped by the public’s stake in those acts. See, e.g., The Binghamton Bridge, 3 Wall. 51, 75, 18 L.Ed. 137 (1866) (describing a rule of construction borrowed from English common law and reflected in the decisions of the several States).
 
The construction of contracts and deeds, by contrast, sometimes involves subsidiary findings of fact. Our treatment of subsidiary evidentiary findings as findings of fact in this context makes sense because, in construing contracts and deeds, “the avowed purpose and primary function of the court is to ascertain the intention of the parties.” 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 30:2, pp. 17–18 (4th ed. 2012) (Williston); see also Reed v. Proprietors of Locks and Canals on Merrimac River, 8 How. 274, 288–289, 12 L.Ed. 1077 (1850). Sometimes that intention is clearly “set forth in the express language of the contract,” 11 Williston § 31:1, at 341–342, so no subsidiary findings of fact are necessary to its construction, id., § 30:1. But when ambiguities require a court to look beyond the express language, its search for intent becomes factual in nature. That search focuses on “real intention[s]”—embodied in an actual meeting of minds or an actual conveyance of a physical parcel of land—that have an existence outside the written instrument and that the instrument merely records. See William & James Brown & Co. v. McGran, 14 Pet. 479, 493, 10 L.Ed. 550 (1840) (Story, J.); Reed, supra, at 289. See generally Union Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 10 Ct.Cl. 548, 577–578 (1874) (declining to interpret a contract-like statute according to contract rules because “[a]ll the terms of the compact are dictated and accepted by one side, and the only intent which judicial construction can make certain is the intent of the legislative power”), cited in 3 N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction § 63:1, p. 405, n. 6 (7th ed. 2008).
 
Of course, not all subsidiary inquiries that a court makes in the course of construing contracts amount to findings of fact. For example, when a court searches for the meaning that a hypothetical person “conversant with the subject-matter with which the contract is dealing” would give to the words of the contract, its conclusion often remains one of law. Silver King Coalition Mines Co. of Nevada v. Silver King Consol. Mining Co. of Utah, 204 F. 166 (C.A.8 1913), cited in Advisory Committee’s *847 1937 Notes on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52, 28 U.S.C.App., p. 686.
 
The question we must ask, then, is whether the subsidiary findings underlying claim construction more closely resemble the subsidiary findings underlying the construction of statutes or those underlying the construction of contracts and deeds that are treated as findings of fact. This, in turn, depends on whether patent claims are more like statutes or more like contracts and deeds.
 

B
A patent, generally speaking, is “an official document reflecting a grant by a sovereign that is made public, or ‘patent.’ ” Marvin M. Brandt Revocable Trust, supra, at ––––, 134 S.Ct., at 1262. Invention patents originated not as private property rights, but as royal prerogatives. See 4 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 350–351 (1924). They could be issued and revoked only by the Crown, which sometimes used the patent to delegate governmental power to regulate an industry. Id., at 344–347. Provoked by the Crown’s use of these so-called “monopoly patents” to promote private economic interests over innovation and beneficial commerce, Parliament enacted the Statute of Monopolies in 1624. Id., at 353. But even under the regime that Parliament put in place, patents remained sovereign grants, issued, enforced, and revoked by the Privy Council. Lemley, Why Do Juries Decide if Patents are Valid? 99 Va. L.Rev. 1673, 1681 (2013).
 
The Framers adopted a similar scheme. Article I of the U.S. Constitution vests the patent power in Congress, authorizing it “[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.” U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 8. Although Congress could issue such patents as special statutes, see, e.g., Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539, 549–550, 14 L.Ed. 532 (1853), it has mostly acted by authorizing the Executive Branch to issue patents when certain statutory requirements are met. See 35 U.S.C. § 151; see also Act of July 8, 1870, § 31, 16 Stat. 202; Act of July 4, 1836, § 7, 5 Stat. 119; Act of Apr. 10, 1790, ch. 7, § 1, 1 Stat. 109–110.
 
Like the royal prerogatives that were their historical antecedents, patents have a regulatory effect: They “restrain others from manufacturing, using or selling that which [the patent holder] has invented” for a specified period of time. Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U.S. 502, 510, 37 S.Ct. 416, 61 L.Ed. 871 (1917) (emphasis added). And because the regulatory scope of a patent is determined by the claims in the patent, the subsidiary findings that a court makes during claim construction contribute to rules that limit conduct by the public at large.
 
Because they are governmental dispositions and provide rules that bind the public at large, patent claims resemble statutes. The scope of a patent holder’s monopoly right is defined by claims legally actualized through the procedures established by Congress pursuant to its patent power. Thus, a patent holder’s actual intentions have effect only to the extent that they are expressed in the public record. See Keystone Bridge Co. v. Phoenix Iron Co., 95 U.S. 274, 279, 24 L.Ed. 344 (1877); see also Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. v. Davis, 102 U.S. 222, 227, 26 L.Ed. 149 (1880) (examining “the avowed understanding of the patentee,” but disclaiming any holding that such understanding “c[ould] be allowed to enlarge, diminish, or vary the language of a patent afterwards issued”).
 
*848 Moreover, because the ultimate meaning of a patent claim, like the ultimate meaning of a statute, binds the public at large, it should not depend on the specific evidence presented in a particular infringement case. Although the party presentations shape even statutory construction, de novo review on appeal helps to ensure that the construction is not skewed by the specific evidence presented in a given case.
 

C
For purposes of construction, contracts and deeds are less natural analogies for patents. In particular, patents lack the characteristics of those instruments that have justified departing from the usual practice of treating document construction as a wholly legal inquiry, not subject to subsidiary findings of fact.
 
To be sure, we have occasionally characterized a patent as “a carefully crafted bargain” between the inventor and the public. Pfaff v. Wells Electronics, Inc., 525 U.S. 55, 63, 119 S.Ct. 304, 142 L.Ed.2d 261 (1998); see also Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322, 327–328, 16 L.Ed. 165 (1859); Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 218, 242, 8 L.Ed. 376 (1832). But, as our decisions have also recognized, the patent is perhaps better characterized as a reward for feats already accomplished—that is, innovation and public disclosure—than as a mutual exchange of executory promises. See, e.g., Motion Picture Patents Co., supra, at 513, 37 S.Ct. 416; Seymour v. Osborne, 11 Wall. 516, 533–534, 20 L.Ed. 33 (1871); Grant, supra, at 242; see also Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 985, n. 14 (C.A.Fed.1995), aff’d 517 U.S. 370, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996) (distinguishing patents from contracts). In granting a patent, the Government is acting not as a party to a bilateral contract binding upon itself alone, but instead as a sovereign bestowing upon the inventor a right to exclude the public at large from the invention marked out by his claims.
 
In this sense, patents are more closely analogous to deeds, Motion Picture Patents Co., supra, at 510, 37 S.Ct. 416 (collecting cases), because they share the common characteristic of describing rights that the owner holds against the world. See Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 162, 109 S.Ct. 971, 103 L.Ed.2d 118 (1989). But in the context of land patents, we have been unwilling to interpret sovereign dispositions in the same way we interpret analogous private conveyances. See, e.g., Leo Sheep Co., 440 U.S., at 680–682, 99 S.Ct. 1403; Missouri, K. & T.R. Co. v. Kansas Pacific R. Co., 97 U.S. 491, 497, 24 L.Ed. 1095 (1878); Leavenworth, L. & G.R. Co. v. United States, 92 U.S. 733, 740–741, 23 L.Ed. 634 (1876); see also Marvin M. Brandt Revocable Trust, supra (interpreting a land grant as a statute rather than as a deed). We should not blithely extend the rules governing the construction of deeds to their even more distant cousins, invention patents.2
 
*849 Bearing these differences in mind, the subsidiary facts relevant to the construction of patents, on the one hand, and contracts and deeds, on the other, differ substantially. As explained above, we have justified treating subsidiary determinations about the actual intentions of parties to contracts and deeds as findings of fact. But the subsidiary determinations about patent claims that the majority identifies as factual do not concern historical facts, such as what the parties agreed to do or how a given parcel of land is situated. See William & James Brown & Co., 14 Pet., at 493; Reed, 8 How., at 289.
 
For example, the “fact” of how a skilled artisan would understand a given term or phrase at a particular point in history is a legal fiction; it has no existence independent of the claim construction process. There is no actual “skilled artisan” who, at the moment the application was filed, formed an understanding of the terms of the claim—an understanding that an omniscient factfinder could ascertain. Neither is the skilled artisan’s understanding a proxy for some external fact that, could the court know it, would supply the meaning of a patent claim. Whatever the scope of the inventor’s right under the patent before the introduction of claims, the law has limited that right to the claims as written in the patent. See Markman, supra, at 379, 116 S.Ct. 1384. Our decision in Markman rested in part on this characteristic of claim construction, distinguishing it from other patent determinations that must go to a jury because they require the factfinder to inspect “ ‘an embodied conception outside of the patent itself’ ” or things “ ‘which have their existence in pais.’ ” 517 U.S., at 385–386, 116 S.Ct. 1384 (distinguishing Bischoff v. Wethered, 9 Wall. 812, 19 L.Ed. 829 (1870)).
 
Because the skilled artisan inquiry in claim construction more closely resembles determinations categorized as “conclusions of law” than determinations categorized as “findings of fact,” I would hold that it falls outside the scope of Rule 52(a)(6) and is subject to de novo review.
 

II
A
The majority makes little effort to justify its assertion that the subsidiary determinations a district court makes in the course of claim construction are findings of fact. And the few analogies that it attempts to draw either lack support or prove too much.
 
For example, relying on Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., 259 U.S. 285, 292, 42 S.Ct. 477, 66 L.Ed. 943 (1922), the majority compares the search for the meaning of “ ‘technical words or phrases not commonly understood’ ” in claim construction *850 to “questions of fact” about the scope of a railway tariff. See ante, at 847. It is true that, in Great Northern, the Court referred to questions of fact arising in the context of contract construction, which, it pointed out, must go to a jury. 259 U.S., at 292–293, 42 S.Ct. 477. But the Court’s conclusion that similar questions must be settled by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) when they relate to the interpretation of a railway tariff merely proves the point that the allocation of a technical usage inquiry depends upon the legal instrument that the court is construing. In that case, the Court was faced with a tariff filed with, and administered by, the ICC. And it was not concerned with allocating evidentiary determinations between trial and appellate courts, but with allocating them between an agency and the judiciary. Id., at 289, 42 S.Ct. 477. So understood, the distinction the Court drew pertains more to an emerging rule of administrative deference than to a definitive classification of judicial determinations.
 
Further reinforcing the point that the nature of the legal instrument dictates our treatment of subsidiary findings is that, although terms in statutes and regulations frequently have technical meanings unknown outside the specialized community they are meant to regulate, we treat the inquiry into those meanings as involving only conclusions of law. See, e.g., Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Hiles, 516 U.S. 400, 401–407, 413–414, 116 S.Ct. 890, 134 L.Ed.2d 34 (1996); Aluminum Co. of America v. Central Lincoln Peoples’ Util. Dist., 467 U.S. 380, 390, 104 S.Ct. 2472, 81 L.Ed.2d 301 (1984). The majority’s unexamined reliance on technical usage could be read to cast doubt on this practice, as well as on our holding in Markman that claim construction is exclusively for the court. If claim construction involves subsidiary questions of technical meaning or usage that are indistinguishable from those questions submitted to the jury in the contract context, see 12 Williston § 34:19, then one might wonder why such issues are not submitted to the jury in the patent and statute contexts, too.
 
The majority also analogizes to the obviousness inquiry in patent law, which involves findings of fact subject to Rule 52(a)(6). Ante, at 840 – 841 (citing Dennison Mfg. Co. v. Panduit Corp., 475 U.S. 809, 811, 106 S.Ct. 1578, 89 L.Ed.2d 817 (1986) (per curiam )). But this analogy is even further off the mark because obviousness turns on historical facts about the circumstances of the invention, rather than on the construction of a written instrument. Id., at 810–811, 106 S.Ct. 1578. Cf. Markman, supra, at 386, 116 S.Ct. 1384 (distinguishing the novelty inquiry from claim construction on these grounds).
 

B
Nor does the majority attempt to justify its holding by reference to which “ ‘judicial actor is better positioned ... to decide the issue in question,’ ” Markman, supra, at 388, 116 S.Ct. 1384—an inquiry that we have also treated as relevant to the classification of fact versus law, Miller, 474 U.S., at 114, 106 S.Ct. 445. In resolving issues of judicial administration, we have considered that federal appellate courts are “expositor[s] of law,” ibid., and have acknowledged that they are better positioned than district courts to promote uniformity, Markman, supra, at 390, 116 S.Ct. 1384; see also Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 697–698, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). We have recognized, however, that trial courts have a special competence in judging witness credibility and weighing the evidence, Miller, supra, at 114, 106 S.Ct. 445, and have been cautious not to waste judicial and party resources through needless relitigation, see Anderson v. Bessemer *851 City, 470 U.S. 564, 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).
 
To the extent that the construction of a patent claim turns on testimony of expert witnesses, especially live testimony, there is no denying that it falls within the bounds of a district court’s special competence. But as we recognized in Markman, and as the majority is careful to reiterate today, “subsidiary factfinding is unlikely to loom large in the universe of litigated claim construction.” Ante, at 840. The majority’s reluctance to highlight “allocation,” Miller, supra at 113, 106 S.Ct. 445, is thus understandable. The arguments favoring allocation to the district court, diminished by the majority’s own prediction, are outweighed by the remaining rule-of-law and uniformity considerations that factored into our allocation in Markman, 517 U.S., at 388–391, 116 S.Ct. 1384.
 

1
We have long been cautious not to allocate issues in a way that would “strip a federal appellate court of its primary function as an expositor of law.” Miller, 474 U.S., at 114, 106 S.Ct. 445. Although we have recognized that “an issue does not lose its factual character merely because its resolution is dispositive of the ultimate” dispute, id., at 113, 106 S.Ct. 445, we have been less inclined to defer to seemingly factual determinations that play a dispositive role in the development of legal rules. For example, we have sanctioned de novo appellate review of the mixed determinations of “probable cause” and “reasonable suspicion” on the ground that “the legal rules ... acquire content only through application.” Ornelas, supra, at 697, 116 S.Ct. 1657; see also Miller, supra, at 116, 106 S.Ct. 445. Although such determinations depend on the specific facts in a case, their role in shaping rules of law demand a de novo standard of review.
 
As previously noted, patents are authoritative governmental dispositions. Thus, when a judge construes a patent, he is, in a very real sense, “say[ing] what the law is,” Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803), not just for the parties to the dispute, but for the public at large. It follows that, any time a district court’s claim construction turns on subsidiary evidentiary disputes, the majority’s rule will distort the appellate court’s construction of the law by requiring it to defer to subsidiary determinations that are dispositive as to its meaning. Surely the majority would not countenance such an abdication of the appellate court’s role in the construction of statutes. Yet the majority has not justified applying a different rule to the construction of legislative acts that take the form of a patent.
 

2
The need for uniformity in claim construction also weighs heavily in favor of de novo review of subsidiary evidentiary determinations. Uniformity is a critical feature of our patent system because “ ‘[t]he limits of a patent must be known for the protection of the patentee, the encouragement of the inventive genius of others and the assurance that the subject of the patent will be dedicated ultimately to the public.’ ” Markman, 517 U.S., at 390, 116 S.Ct. 1384. If the boundaries of the patent right could shift from case to case, then the result would be “a ‘zone of uncertainty which enterprise and experimentation may enter only at the risk of infringement.’ ” Ibid.; see also Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U.S. 722, 731, 122 S.Ct. 1831, 152 L.Ed.2d 944 (2002). So damaging is this unpredictability that we identified uniformity as an “independent” reason justifying our allocation of claim construction to the court. See Markman, supra, at 390, 116 S.Ct. 1384.
 
*852 The majority attempts to downplay the effect its decision will have on uniformity by pointing out that “prior cases [construing the same claim] will sometimes be binding because of issue preclusion, and sometimes will serve as persuasive authority.” Ante, at 840 (citing Markman, supra, at 391, 116 S.Ct. 1384; citation omitted). But we have already rejected the notion that issue preclusion adequately safeguards the uniformity that our patent system requires. See Markman, supra, at 391, 116 S.Ct. 1384.
 
Perhaps the majority is correct that “subsidiary factfinding is unlikely to loom large in the universe of litigated claim construction.” Ante, at 840. But I doubt it. If this case proves anything, it is that the line between fact and law is an uncertain one—made all the more uncertain by the majority’s failure to identify sound principles for the lines it draws. The majority’s rule provides litigants who prevail in district court a significant opportunity and incentive to take advantage of this uncertainty by arguing on appeal that the district court’s claim construction involved subsidiary findings of fact. At best, today’s holding will spawn costly—and, if the majority is correct about the frequency with which these evidentiary determinations make a difference, meritless—collateral litigation over the line between law and fact. We generally avoid any rule of judicial administration that “results in a substantial expenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult questions that have no effect on the outcome of the case,” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236–237, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009), and there is no reason to embrace one here. But I fear worse: that today’s decision will result in fewer claim construction decisions receiving precedential effect, thereby injecting uncertainty into the world of invention and innovation.
 
In short, the majority’s rule finds no support in either the historical understanding of “findings of fact” or considerations of policy that have served as our guide when we have been confronted with a difficult question of fact-law classification. I would not adopt it.

The Court of Appeals reviewed de novo not only the District Court’s claim construction, but also its holding that the claims were sufficiently definite to satisfy 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 2 (2006 ed.). I would hold that the Court of Appeals correctly treated the indefiniteness inquiry as a question of law because it depends entirely on claim construction.
 
“[A] patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the specification delineating the patent, and the prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.” Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 572 U.S. ––––, ––––, 134 S.Ct. 2120, 2124, 189 L.Ed.2d 37 (2014). This standard falls somewhere between a notice requirement and a prohibition on ambiguity. See id., at –––– – ––––, 134 S.Ct., at 2128–2130. Determining whether a claim is indefinite is thus akin to other legal inquiries commonly performed in the course of interpreting written instruments. See, e.g., Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U.S. 44, 52–53, 131 S.Ct. 704, 178 L.Ed.2d 588 (2011) (reviewing without deference the district court’s determination that a statute is unambiguous at step one of Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)); 11 Williston § 30:5, at 75 (“The determination of whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court”). Thus, a holding that a patent satisfies the definiteness *853 requirement does not turn on “findings of fact” as that term is used in Rule 52(a)(6), and the Court of Appeals properly applied a de novo standard of review.

Although it relied on expert testimony to understand the science underlying petitioners’ claims, the District Court made no “findings of fact” as that term is used in Rule 52(a)(6). Thus, the Court of Appeals properly reviewed the District Court’s conclusions of law de novo. I respectfully dissent.

The majority argues that we are bound by petitioners' phrasing of the question presented and by respondents' concession at oral argument that claim construction “will sometimes require subsidiary factfinding.” Ante, at 840. But the parties' stipulations that claim construction involves subsidiary factual determinations, with which I do not quarrel, do not settle the question whether those determinations are “findings of fact” within the meaning of Rule 52(a)(6). And to the extent that the majority premises its holding on what it sees as stipulations that these determinations are “findings of fact” for purposes of Rule 52(a)(6), then its holding applies only to the present dispute, and other parties remain free to contest this premise in the future.

The Anglo–American legal tradition has long distinguished between “core” private rights—including the traditional property rights represented by deeds—and other types of rights. Nelson, Adjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L.Rev. 559, 567 (2007) (Nelson). These other rights fall into two categories: “ ‘public rights belonging to the people at large,’ ” and “privileges” or “franchises,” “which public authorities ha[ve] created purely for reasons of public policy and which ha [ve] no counterpart in the Lockean state of nature.” Id., at 566–567 Notwithstanding a movement to recognize a “core” property right in inventions, the English common law placed patents squarely in the final category, as franchises that “depend upon express legislation,” and “hath [their] essence by positive municipal law.” 7 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 479, n. 7, 480, and n. 4, 497 (1926). The distinction between “core” private rights, on the one hand, and public rights and government-created privileges, on the other, has traditionally had significant implications for the way in which rights are adjudicated. Nelson, supra. Thus, no matter how closely a franchise resembles some “core” private right, it does not follow that it must be subject to the same rules of judicial interpretation as its counterpart.
Cases interpreting deeds and land patents exemplify this rule and show why the majority's assertion that patents affect fewer people than statutes, in addition to being a dubious overgeneralization, is not a material distinction. Land patents are more like deeds than statutes in the sense that their effects are more localized, yet the judicial power approaches them differently because they dispose of public rights held by the government on behalf of the people, Nelson 566. See also The Binghamton Bridge, 3 Wall. 51, 75, 18 L.Ed. 137 (1866) (interpreting a state grant of a corporate charter as a “contract” but subject to the special common-law rule that all ambiguities must be construed in favor of the State because “in grants by the public nothing passes by implication”).
