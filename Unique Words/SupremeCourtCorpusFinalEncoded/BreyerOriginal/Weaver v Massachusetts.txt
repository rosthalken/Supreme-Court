Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Kagan joins, dissenting.

 [**441]  The Court notes that Strickland’s “prejudice inquiry is not meant to be applied in a ‘mechanical’ fashion,” ante, at ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 434 (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 696, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984)), and I agree. But, in my view, it follows from this principle that a defendant who shows that his attorney’s constitutionally [***37]  deficient performance produced a structural error should not face the additional—and often insurmountable—Strickland hurdle of demonstrating that the error changed the outcome of his proceeding.

In its harmless-error cases, this Court has “divided constitutional errors into two classes”: trial errors and structural errors. United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 148, 126 S. Ct. 2557, 165 L. Ed. 2d 409 (2006). Trial errors are discrete mistakes that “occu[r] during the presentation of the case to the jury.” Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 307, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1991). Structural errors, on the other hand, “affec[t] the framework within which the trial proceeds.” Id., at 310, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302.

The Court has recognized that structural errors’ distinctive attributes make them “defy analysis by ‘harmless-error’ standards.” Id., at 309, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302. It has therefore categorically exempted structural errors from the case-by-case harmlessness review to which trial errors are subjected. Our precedent does not try to parse which structural errors are the truly egregious ones. It simply views all structural errors as “intrinsically harmful” and holds that any structural error warrants “automatic reversal” on direct appeal “without regard to [its] effect on the outcome” of a trial. Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 7, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999).

The majority here does not take this approach. It assumes that some structural errors—those that “lead to fundamental [***38]  unfairness”—but not others, can warrant relief without a showing of actual prejudice under Strickland. Ante, at ___, ___ - ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 432, 434-435. While I agree that a showing of fundamental unfairness is sufficient to satisfy Strickland, I would not try to draw this distinction.

 [*1917]  Even if some structural errors do not create fundamental unfairness, all structural errors nonetheless have features that make them “defy analysis by ‘harmless-error’ standards.” Fulminante, supra, at 309,111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302. This is why all structural errors—not just the “fundamental unfairness” ones—are exempt from harmlessness inquiry and warrant automatic reversal on direct review. Those same features mean that all structural errors defy an actual-prejudice analysis under Strickland.

For instance, the majority concludes that some errors—such as the public-trial error at issue in this case—have been labeled “structural” because they have effects that “are simply too hard to measure.” Ante, at ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 431; see, e.g., Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 281-282, 113 S. Ct. 2078, 124 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1993) (explaining that structural errors have “consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate”). But how could any error whose effects are inherently indeterminate prove susceptible to actual-prejudice analysis under Strickland?  [**442]  Just as the [***39]  “difficulty of assessing the effect” of such an error would turn harmless-error analysis into “a speculative inquiry into what might have occurred in an alternate universe,” Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 149, n. 4, 150, 126 S. Ct. 2557, 165 L. Ed. 2d 409, so too would it undermine a defendant’s ability to make an actual-prejudice showing to establish an ineffective-assistance claim.

The problem is evident with regard to public-trial violations. This Court has recognized that “the benefits of a public trial are frequently intangible, difficult to prove, or a matter of chance.” Waller v. Georgia, 467 U. S. 39, 49, n. 9, 104 S. Ct. 2210, 81 L. Ed. 2d 31 (1984). As a result, “a requirement that prejudice be shown ‘would in most cases deprive [the defendant] of the [public-trial] guarantee, for it would be difficult to envisage a case in which he would have evidence available of specific injury.’” Ibid. (quoting United States ex rel. Bennett v. Rundle, 419 F. 2d 599, 608 (CA3 1969) (en banc)) (alteration in original). In order to establish actual prejudice from an attorney’s failure to object to a public-trial violation, a defendant would face the nearly impossible burden of establishing how his trial might have gone differently had it been open to the public. See ibid. (“‘[D]emonstration of prejudice in this kind of case is a practical impossibility . . .’” (quoting State v. Sheppard, 182 Conn. 412, 418, 438 A. 2d 125, 128 (1980))).

I do not see how we can read Strickland as requiring defendants [***40]  to prove what this Court has held cannot be proved. If courts do not presume prejudice when counsel’s deficient performance leads to a structural error, then defendants may well be unable to obtain relief for incompetence that deprived them “of basic protections without which a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence.” Neder, supra, at 8-9, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (internal quotation marks omitted). This would be precisely the sort of “mechanical” application that Strickland tells us to avoid.

In my view, we should not require defendants to take on a task that is normally impossible to perform. Nor would I give lower courts the unenviably complex job of deciphering which structural errors really undermine fundamental fairness and which do not—that game is not worth the candle. I would simply say that just as structural errors are categorically insusceptible to harmless-error analysis on direct review, so too are they categorically insusceptible to actual-prejudice analysis in Strickland claims. A showing that an attorney’s constitutionally deficient performance produced a structural error should consequently  [*1918]  be enough to entitle a defendant to relief. I [***41]  respectfully dissent.
