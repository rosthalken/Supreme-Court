
In the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (FCRA or Act), 15 U. S. C. §1681 et seq., Congress required consumer reporting agencies, whenever preparing a consumer report, to “follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.” §1681e(b). To promote adherence to     the Act’s procedural requirements, Congress granted adversely affected consumers a right to sue noncomplying reporting agencies. §1681n (willful noncompliance); §1681o (negligent noncompliance). 1Link to the text of the note Thomas Robins instituted suit    against Spokeo, Inc., alleging that Spokeo was a reporting agency governed by the FCRA, and that Spokeo maintains on its Web site an inaccurate consumer report about Robins. App. 13.

In particular, Robins alleged that Spokeo posted “a picture . . . purport[ing] to be an image of Robins [that] was not in fact [of him],” and incorrectly reported that Robins “was in his 50s, . . . married, . . . employed in a professional or technical field, and . . . has children.” Id., at 14. Robins further alleged that Spokeo’s profile of him continues to misrepresent “that he has a graduate degree, that his economic health is ‘Very Strong[,]’ and that his wealth level [is in] the ‘Top 10%.’” Ibid. Spokeo displayed that erroneous information, Robins asserts, when he was “out of work” and “actively seeking employment.” Ibid. Because of the misinformation, Robins stated, he encountered “[imminent and ongoing] actual harm to [his] employment prospects.” Ibid. 2Link to the text of the note As Robins elaborated on brief, Spokeo’s report made him appear overqualified for jobs he might have gained, expectant of a higher salary than employers    would be willing to pay, and less mobile because of family responsibilities. See Brief for Respondent 44.

I agree with much of the Court’s opinion. Robins, the Court holds, meets the particularity requirement for standing under Article III. See ante, at ___, ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 644, 646 (remanding only for concreteness inquiry). The Court acknowledges that Congress has the authority to confer rights and delineate claims for relief where none existed before. Ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 645; see Federal Election Comm’n v. Akins, 524 U. S. 11, 19-20, 118 S. Ct. 1777, 141 L. Ed. 2d 10 (1998) (holding that inability to procure information to which Congress has created a right in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 qualifies as concrete injury satisfying Article III’s standing requirement);    Public Citizen v. Department of Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 449, 109 S. Ct. 2558, 105 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1989) (holding that plaintiff advocacy organizations’ inability to obtain information that Congress made subject to disclosure    under the Federal Advisory Committee Act “constitutes a sufficiently distinct injury to provide standing to sue”); Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U. S. 363, 373, 102 S. Ct. 1114, 71 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1982) (identifying, as Article III injury, violation of plaintiff’s right, secured by the Fair Housing Act, to “truthful information concerning the availability of housing”). 3Link to the text of the note Congress’     connection of procedural requirements to the prevention of a substantive harm, the Court appears to agree, is “instructive and important.” Ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 645; see Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 580, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (“As Government programs and policies become more complex and far reaching, we must be sensitive to the articulation of new rights of action . . . .”); Brief for Restitution and Remedies Scholars et al. as Amici Curiae 3 (“Congress cannot authorize individual plaintiffs to enforce generalized rights that belong to the whole public. But Congress can create new individual rights, and it can enact effective remedies for those rights.”). See generally Sunstein, Informational Regulation and Informational Standing: Akins and Beyond, 147 U. Pa. L. Rev. 613 (1999).

I part ways with the Court, however, on the necessity of a remand to determine whether Robins’ particularized injury was “concrete.” See ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 646. Judged by what we have said about “concreteness,” Robins’ allegations carry him across the threshold. The Court’s opinion observes that time and again, our decisions have coupled the words “concrete and particularized.” Ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 644 (citing as examples, Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U. S. ___, ___, 134 S. Ct. 2334, 2341, 189 L. Ed. 2d 246, 255 (2014) ); Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U. S. 488, 493, 129 S. Ct. 1142, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2009); Sprint Communications Co. v. APCC Services, Inc., 554 U. S. 269, 274, 128 S. Ct. 2531, 171 L. Ed. 2d 424 (2008); Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, 517, 127 S. Ct. 1438, 167 L. Ed. 2d 248 (2007)). True, but true too, in the four cases cited by the Court, and many others, opinions do not discuss the separate offices of the terms “concrete” and “particularized.”

Inspection of the Court’s decisions suggests that the particularity requirement bars complaints raising generalized grievances, seeking relief that no more benefits the plaintiff than it does the public at large. See, e.g., Lujan, 504 U. S., at 573-574, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (a plaintiff “seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large does not state an Article III case or controversy” (punctuation omitted)); Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U. S. 113, 125, 60 S. Ct. 869, 84 L. Ed. 1108 (1940) (plaintiffs lack standing because they failed to show injury    to “a particular right of their own, as distinguished from the public’s interest in the administration of the law”). Robins’ claim does not present a question of that character. He seeks redress, not for harm to the citizenry, but for Spokeo’s spread of misinformation specifically about him.

Concreteness as a discrete requirement for standing, the Court’s decisions indicate,     refers to the reality of an injury, harm that is real, not abstract, but not necessarily tangible. See ante, at ___ - ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 644-645; ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 646 (Thomas, J., concurring). Illustrative opinions include Akins, 524 U. S., at 20, 118 S. Ct. 1777, 141 L. Ed. 2d 10 (“[C]ourts will not pass     upon abstract, intellectual problems, but adjudicate concrete, living contests between adversaries.” (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)); Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54, 67, 106 S. Ct. 1697, 90 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1986) (plaintiff’s “abstract concern does not substitute for the concrete injury required by Art[icle] III” (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted)); Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 101, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983) (“Plaintiffs must demonstrate a personal stake in the outcome . . . . Abstract injury is not enough.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 297-298, 99 S. Ct. 2301, 60 L. Ed. 2d 895 (1979) (“The difference between an abstract question and a ‘case or controversy’ is one of degree, of course, and is not discernable by any precise test. The basic inquiry is whether the conflicting    contentions of the parties present a real, substantial controversy between parties having adverse legal interests, a dispute definite and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract.” (citation, some internal quotation marks, and ellipsis omitted)); Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 40, 96 S. Ct. 1917, 48 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1976) (“organization’s abstract concern . . . does not substitute for the concrete injury required by Art. III”); California Bankers Assn. v. Shultz, 416 U. S. 21, 69, 94 S. Ct. 1494, 39 L. Ed. 2d 812 (1974) (“There must be . . . concrete adverseness”; “[a]bstract injury is not enough.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Railway Mail Assn. v. Corsi, 326 U. S. 88, 93, 65 S. Ct. 1483, 89 L. Ed. 2072 (1945) (controversy must be “definite and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract”); Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 460, 59 S. Ct. 972, 83 L. Ed. 1385 (1939) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.) (“[I]t [is] not for courts to pass upon . . . abstract, intellectual problems but only . . . concrete, living contest[s] between adversaries call[ing] for the arbitrament of law.”).

Robins would not qualify, the Court observes, if he alleged a “bare” procedural violation, ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 646, one that results in no harm, for example, “an incorrect zip code,” ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 646. Far from an incorrect zip code, Robins complains of misinformation about his education, family situation, and economic status, inaccurate representations that could affect his fortune in the job market. See Brief for Center for Democracy & Technology et al. as Amici Curiae 13 (Spokeo’s inaccuracies    bore on Robins’ “ability to find employment by creating the erroneous impression that he was overqualified for the work he was seeking, that he might be unwilling to relocate for a job due to family commitments, or that his salary demands would exceed what prospective employers were prepared to offer him.”); Brief for Restitution and Remedies Scholars et al. as Amici Curiae 35 (“An applicant can lose [a] job for being over-qualified; a suitor can lose a woman if she reads that he is married.”). The FCRA’s procedural requirements aimed to prevent such harm. See 115 Cong. Rec. 2410-2415 (1969). I therefore see no utility in returning this case to the Ninth Circuit to underscore what Robins’ complaint already conveys concretely:     Spokeo’s misinformation “cause[s] actual harm to [his] employment prospects.” App. 14.

For the reasons stated, I would affirm the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.

Congress added the right of action for willful violations in 1996 as part of the Consumer Credit Reporting Reform Act, 110 Stat. 3009-426.

2Link to the location of the note in the document
Because this case remains at the pleading stage, the court of first instance must assume the truth of Robins’ factual allegations. In particular, that court must assume, subject to later proof, that Spokeo is a consumer reporting agency under 15 U. S. C. §1681a(f) and that, in preparing consumer reports, Spokeo does not employ reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy, in violation of the FCRA.

3Link to the location of the note in the document
Just as the right to truthful information at stake in Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U. S. 363, 102 S. Ct. 1114, 71 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1982), was closely tied to the Fair Housing Act’s goal of eradicating racial discrimination in housing,    so the right here at stake is closely tied to the FCRA’s goal of protecting consumers against dissemination of inaccurate credit information about them.
