JAMES BROGAN, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

No. 96-1579

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

118 S. Ct. 805

December 2, 1997, Argued 
January 26, 1998, Decided

JUSTICE SOUTER, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I join the opinion of the Court except for its response to petitioner's argument premised on the potential for prosecutorial abuse of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 as now written (ante, 7-8). On that point I have joined JUSTICE GINSBURG's opinion espousing congressional attention to the risks inherent in the statute's current breadth.
