Supreme Court of the United States
UNION BANK, Petitioner
v.
Herbert WOLAS, Chapter 7 Trustee for the Estate of ZZZZ Best Co., Inc.
No. 90–1491.
|
Argued Nov. 5, 1991.
|
Decided Dec. 11, 1991.

Justice SCALIA, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court, including Parts II and III, which respond persuasively to legislative-history and policy arguments made by respondent. It is regrettable that we have a legal culture in which such arguments have to be addressed (and are indeed credited by a Court of Appeals), with respect to a statute utterly devoid of language that could remotely be thought to distinguish between long-term and short-term debt. Since there was here no contention of a “scrivener’s error” producing an absurd result, the plain text of the statute should have made this litigation unnecessary and unmaintainable.
