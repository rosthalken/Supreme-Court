
I continue to believe that this case presents a political question inappropriate for judicial resolution. See Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U. S. ___, ___, 132 S. Ct. 1421, 182 L. Ed. 2d 423 (2012) (Breyer, J., dissenting). But because precedent precludes resolving this case on political question grounds, see id., at ___, 132 S. Ct.     1421, 182 L. Ed. 2d 423, 429 (majority opinion), I join the Court’s opinion.
