Supreme Court of the United States
G.P. REED, Petitioner
v.
UNITED TRANSPORTATION UNION et al.
No. 87–1031.
|
Argued Nov. 2, 1988.
|
Decided Jan. 11, 1989.

Justice SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.

I remain of the view that the Court should apply the appropriate state statute of limitations (if any at all) when a federal statute lacks an explicit limitations period. See Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley–Duff & Associates, Inc., 483 U.S. 143, 170, 107 S.Ct. 2759, 2774, 97 L.Ed.2d 121 (1987) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.
