Justice THOMAS, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court on the understanding that the “misrepresentation[s] ... of ... material fact” alleged in this case are not properly considered “in connection with” transactions in covered securities. 15 U.S.C. § 78bb(f)(1)(A). We have said that the statutory phrase “in connection with” warrants a “broad interpretation,” Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U.S. 71, 85, 126 S.Ct. 1503, 164 L.Ed.2d 179 (2006), though not so broad as to reach any “common-law fraud that happens to involve securities,” see SEC v. Zandford, 535 U.S. 813, 820, 122 S.Ct. 1899, 153 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002). Considered in isolation, however, that phrase “is essentially ‘indeterminat[e]’ because connections, like relations, ‘stop nowhere.’ ” Maracich v. Spears, 570 U.S. ––––, ––––, 133 S.Ct. 2191, 2200, 186 L.Ed.2d 275 (2013) (some internal quotation marks omitted). The phrase thus “provides little guidance without a limiting principle consistent with the structure of the statute and its other provisions.” Ibid. As I understand it, the opinion of the Court resolves this case by applying a limiting principle to the phrase “in connection with” that is “consistent with the statutory framework and design” of the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, id., at ––––, 133 S.Ct., at 2200, and also consistent with our precedents.
