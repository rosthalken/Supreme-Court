
North Carolina’s law prescribing “periods . . . for the commencement of actions [for personal injury or damage to property],” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §§1-46, 1-52 (Lexis 2013), includes in the same paragraph, §1-52(16), both a discovery rule and an absolute period of repose. Section 1-52(16) states that personal injury and property damage claims

“shall not accrue until bodily harm to the claimant or physical damage to his property becomes apparent or ought reasonably to have become apparent to the claimant . . . . Provided that no [claim] shall accrue more than 10 years from the last act or omission of the defendant giving    rise to the [claim].”

The question presented is whether a federal statute on the timeliness of suits for harm caused by environmental contamination, 42 U. S. C. §9658, preempts North Carolina’s 10-year repose provision.
    The federal statute concerns hazardous-waste-caused injuries with long latency periods that can run 10 to 40 years. To ensure that latent injury claims would not become time barred during the years in which the injury remained without manifestation, Congress amended the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U. S. C. §9601 et seq., to include a provision, §9658, on “actions under state law for damages from exposure to hazardous substances.” See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-962, pp. 87-88, 261 (1986) (hereinafter Conference Report) (problem centers on when state limitations periods begin to run rather than the number of years they run; Congress therefore established “a [f]ederally-required commencement date”). Captioned “Exception to State statutes,” §9658(a)(1) instructs that when the applicable state limitations period specifies “a commencement date . . . earlier than the federally required commencement date,” the federal    date shall apply “in lieu of the date specified in [state law].”

The Court in the case at hand identifies as the relevant prescriptive period North Carolina’s 10-year repose provision. I agree. But as I see it, the later “federally required commencement date,” §9658(a)(1), (b)(4), displaces the earlier date state law prescribes.

    Section 9658(b)(3) defines “commencement date” as “the date specified in a statute of limitations as the beginning of the applicable limitations period.” Under North Carolina law, that date is determined by the occurrence of “the last act or omission of the defendant giving rise to the [claim].” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 1-52(16). The definition key to this controversy, however, appears in §9658(b)(4)(A): “‘[F]ederally required commencement date’ means the date the plaintiff knew (or reasonably should have known) that [her] injury . . . [was] caused . . . by the hazardous substance . . . concerned.” Congress, in short, directed, in §9658(a)(1), that the federally prescribed discovery rule, set out in §9658(b)(4), shall apply “in lieu of” the earlier “commencement date” (the defendant’s “last act or omission”) specified in N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §1-52(16).

Why does    the Court fight this straightforward reading? At length, the Court’s opinion distinguishes statutes of limitations from statutes of repose. See ante, at ___ - ___, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 72-79. Yet North Carolina itself made its repose period a component of the statute prescribing periods for “the commencement of actions.” §§1-46, 1-52(16). What is a repose period, in essence, other than a limitations period unattended by a discovery rule? See Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Superfund Section 301(e) Study Group, Injuries and Damages from Hazardous Wastes—Analysis and Improvement of Legal Remedies, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., (pt. 1) 255-256 (Comm. Print 1982) (hereinafter Study Group Report).

The legislative history of §9658, moreover, shows why the distinction the Court draws between statutes of limitations and repose prescriptions, ante, at ___ - ___, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 70-71, Congress amended CERCLA to include §9658 in response to the report of an expert Study Group commissioned when CERCLA was enacted. That report directed its proposals to the States rather than to Congress. It “recommend[ed] that the several states enhance and develop common law and statutory remedies, and that    they remove unreasonable procedural and other barriers to recovery in court action for personal injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous waste.” Study Group Report 255. The report then made specific proposals.     Under the heading “Statutes of Limitations,” the Study Group proposed (1) “that all [S]tates . . . clearly adopt the rule that an action accrues when the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the injury or disease and its cause” and (2) that States repeal “statutes of repose which, in a number of [S]tates have the same effect as some statutes of limitation in barring plaintiff’s claim before he knows he has one.” Id., at 255-256, 104 S. Ct. 615, 78 L. Ed. 2d 443. Both measures are necessary, the report explained, because “many of the hazardous wastes are carcinogens” with “latency period[s] for the appearance of injury or disease . . . likely to [run] for thirty years or more.” Id., at 255, 104 S. Ct. 615, 78 L. Ed. 2d 443.

Beyond question, a repose period, like the 10-year period at issue here, will prevent recovery for injuries with latency periods running for decades. Thus, altering statutes of limitations to include a discovery rule would be of little use in States with repose prescriptions.

    Rather than await action by the States,    Congress decided to implement the Study Group’s proposal itself by adopting §9658. Ante, at ___, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 71. The Conference Report relates the Study Group Report’s observation that “certain State statutes deprive plaintiffs of their day in court” because “[i]n the case of a long-latency disease, such as cancer,” a limitations period that begins to run before the plaintiff has discovered her injury frequently will make timely suit impossible. Conference Report 261. The Conference Report then states that “[t]his section”—§9658—“addresses the problem identified in the [Study Group Report].” Ibid. As the Study Group Report makes clear, “the problem” it identified, to which the Conference Report adverted, cannot be solved when statutes of repose remain operative. The Court’s interpretation thus thwarts Congress’ clearly expressed intent to fix “the problem” the Study Group described.

In lieu of uniform application of the “federally required commencement date,” §9658(b)(4), the Court allows those responsible for environmental contamination, if they are located in the still small number of States with repose periods, *Link to the text of the note to escape liability for the devastating harm they cause, harm hidden from detection    for more than 10 years. Instead of encouraging prompt identification and remediation of toxic contamination before it can kill, the Court’s decision gives contaminators an incentive to conceal the hazards they have created until the repose period has run its full course.

Far from erring, see ante, at 2, 10, the Fourth Circuit, I am convinced, got it exactly right in holding that §9658 supersedes state law contrary to the federally required discovery rule. I would affirm that court’s sound judgment.
