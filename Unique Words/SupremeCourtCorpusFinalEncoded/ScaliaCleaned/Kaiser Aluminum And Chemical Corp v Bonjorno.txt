
I join the Court’s opinion because I agree that this statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1961 (1982 ed.), contains positive indication that its operation is to be prospective. In my view, however, *841 that indication is unnecessary to our determination. I regret that the Court has chosen not to resolve the conflict between two relatively recent cases saying that unless there is specific indication to the contrary a new statute should be applied retroactively absent “manifest injustice,” Bradley v. Richmond School Bd., 416 U.S. 696, 716, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 2019, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974); Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 282, 89 S.Ct. 518, 526, 21 L.Ed.2d 474 (1969), and the many cases, old and new, which have said that unless there is specific indication to the contrary a new statute should be applied only prospectively, e.g., Bowen v. Georgetown University Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208, 109 S.Ct. 468, 471, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988); United States v. American Sugar Refining Co., 202 U.S. 563, 577, 26 S.Ct. 717, 719, 50 L.Ed. 1149 (1906). In the rules of construction that they announce, if not in the results they produce, these two lines of cases are not merely, as the Court confesses, in “apparent tension,” ante, at 1577; they are in irreconcilable contradiction, and have spawned Courts of Appeals opinions to match. Compare, e.g., Davis v. Omitowoju, 883 F.2d 1155, 1170–1171 (CA3 1989), and Anderson v. USAIR, Inc., 260 U.S.App.D.C. 183, 187, 818 F.2d 49, 53 (1987), with United States v. R.W. Meyer, Inc., 889 F.2d 1497, 1505–1506 (CA6 1989), and United States v. Marengo County Comm’n, 731 F.2d 1546, 1553–1555 (CA11), appeal dism’d, 469 U.S. 976, 105 S.Ct. 375, 83 L.Ed.2d 311 (1984). Since the issue has been briefed and argued in this case, I would have taken the occasion to admit that the rule we expressed in Thorpe and Bradley was wrong, and to reaffirm the clear rule of construction that has been applied, except for these last two decades of confusion, since the beginning of the Republic and indeed since the early days of the common law: absent specific indication to the contrary, the operation of nonpenal legislation is prospective only.1
 

*842 I
During all of the 19th and most of the 20th centuries, our cases expressed and applied, to my knowledge without exception, the principle that legislation is to be applied only prospectively unless Congress specifies otherwise. See the numerous cases cited in Smead, The Rule Against Retroactive Legislation: A Basic Principle of Jurisprudence, 20 Minn.L.Rev. 775, 781, n. 22 (1936). To give a few examples: In United States v. Heth, 3 Cranch 399, 413, 2 L.Ed. 479 (1806), we refused to apply a new (lower) commission rate for customs collectors to amounts already bonded but not yet collected at the time the new rates took effect. Justice Paterson wrote: “Words in a statute ought not to have a retrospective operation, unless they are so clear, strong, and imperative, that no other meaning can be annexed to them, or unless the intention of the legislature cannot be otherwise satisfied.” In Murray v. Gibson, 15 How. 421, 423, 14 L.Ed. 755 (1854), we refused to apply retroactively a Mississippi statute limiting to three years the period in which another state-court judgment would be enforced by Mississippi courts against a citizen of that State. We reaffirmed that “[a]s a general rule for the interpretation of statutes, it may be laid down, that they never **1580 should be allowed a retroactive operation where this is not required by express command or by necessary and unavoidable implication. Without such command or implication they speak and operate on the future only.” A case very similar to the one we decide today is United States v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 276 U.S. 160, 48 S.Ct. 236, 72 L.Ed. 509 (1928). There respondent had been overassessed *843 on federal income and profits taxes. At the time it requested a refund of its overpayment and at the time the refund was allowed by the Commissioner, the relevant statute provided that interest on the amount was “to commence six months after the filing of claim for refund,” id., 276 U.S., at 161, 48 S.Ct., at 236, unless the taxes had been paid under protest. Before the refund was made, however, Congress amended the statute to provide that interest should run from the actual date of the overpayment. Respondent then argued, as do the Bonjorno respondents in these cases, that because “the interest had not yet been paid, respondent became entitled to an amount calculated according to the later enactment.” Id., at 162, 48 S.Ct., at 237. We rejected this argument, reaffirming the presumption that “[s]tatutes are not to be given retroactive effect or construed to change the status of claims fixed in accordance with earlier provisions unless the legislative purpose so to do plainly appears.” Id., at 162–163, 48 S.Ct., at 237. See also the following expressions of the rule:
“Where it is claimed that a law is to have a retrospective operation, such must be clearly the intention, evidenced in the law and its purposes, or the court will presume that the lawmaking power is acting for the future only and not for the past....” White v. United States, 191 U.S. 545, 552 [24 S.Ct. 171, 172, 48 L.Ed. 295] (1903).
“There are certain principles which have been adhered to with great strictness by the courts in relation to the construction of statutes as to whether they are or are not retroactive in their effect. The presumption is very strong that a statute was not meant to act retrospectively, and it ought never to receive such a construction if it is susceptible of any other. It ought not to receive such a construction unless the words used are so clear, strong and imperative that no other meaning can be annexed to them or unless the intention of the legislature cannot be otherwise satisfied.” United States Fidelity *844 & Guaranty Co. v. United States ex rel. Struthers Wells Co., 209 U.S. 306, 314 [28 S.Ct. 537, 539, 52 L.Ed. 804] (1908).
“[A] retrospective operation will not be given to a statute which interferes with antecedent rights or by which human action is regulated, unless such be the unequivocal and inflexible import of the terms, and the manifest intention of the legislature.” Union Pacific R. Co. v. Laramie Stock Yards Co., 231 U.S. 190, 199 [34 S.Ct. 101, 102, 58 L.Ed. 179] (1913).
“The initial admonition is that laws are not to be considered as applying to cases which arose before their passage unless that intention be clearly declared.
 
. . . . .
“If the absence of such determining declaration leaves to the statute a double sense, it is the command of the cases, that that which rejects retroactive application must be selected.” Shwab v. Doyle, 258 U.S. 529, 534–535 [42 S.Ct. 391, 392–393, 66 L.Ed. 747] (1922).
“[A] statute cannot be construed to operate retrospectively unless the legislative intention to that effect unequivocally appears.” Miller v. United States, 294 U.S. 435, 439 [55 S.Ct. 440, 442, 79 L.Ed. 977] (1935).
 
During these more than 150 years of doctrinal certainty, we did not always deny retroactive application to new statutory law. But when we accorded it, the reason was that the statute affirmatively so required. See, e.g., Watson v. Mercer, 8 Pet. 88, 8 L.Ed. 876 (1834); **1581 Graham & Foster v. Goodcell, 282 U.S. 409, 51 S.Ct. 186, 75 L.Ed. 415 (1931). If the new law was silent as to its application, we consistently employed the presumption that it applied only prospectively. See Smead, 20 Minn.L.Rev., at 780–781, and n. 22.
 

II
A
The current confusion began with the case of Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 89 S.Ct. 518, 21 L.Ed.2d 474 (1969), involving the eviction of a tenant from low-income housing operated *845 by the city of Durham, North Carolina. The tenant alleged that her lease had been terminated because of her activities in organizing a tenants’ association, thus violating her First Amendment rights. That claim was rejected by the North Carolina Supreme Court and we granted certiorari. While the case was pending here, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development promulgated a regulation directing that “before instituting an eviction proceeding local housing authorities ... should inform the tenant ... of the reasons for the eviction....” Id., 393 U.S., at 272, 89 S.Ct., at 521. We held that the regulation had to be applied retroactively, to invalidate the eviction order issued almost 18 months before the regulation had been adopted. “The general rule,” we said, “is that an appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision.” Id., at 281, 89 S.Ct., at 526.
 
Thorpe made no mention of our earlier presumption against retroactive application, and cited none of the numerous cases supporting that rule. The reason, apparently, was that it treated as distinctive the situation in which (as in Thorpe ) the change in law occurs between the decision of a lower court and the decision of the appellate tribunal. Thus, it cited and discussed only a few cases in which that situation, or a closely analogous situation, obtained. Foremost among these was Chief Justice Marshall’s opinion in United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103, 2 L.Ed. 49 (1801). The issue there was whether a French vessel, seized by an American ship, could be condemned. The Circuit Court had held that condemnation was proper, but before this Court could issue its decision, the United States entered into a convention with France which provided for the restoration of all French “[p]roperty captured, and not yet definitively condemned....” Id., 1 Cranch, at 107 (emphasis in original). In its determination of whether this provision applied to the case before it, the Court examined the explicit language and held that the phrase “and not yet definitively condemned” required application of the convention to all cases where property had not yet reached final condemnation, *846 even if that property had been seized preconvention. Id., at 109. Explaining this holding, and specifically rejecting respondent’s argument that if the judgment below was correct it could not “be made otherwise by any thing subsequent to its rendition,” ibid., the Court stated:
“[I]f, subsequent to the judgment, and before the decision of the appellate court, a law intervenes and positively changes the rule which governs, the law must be obeyed....” Id., at 110.
 
It is clear that what Schooner Peggy meant by a law that “positively changes the rule which governs” was one which, like the law there at issue, explicitly recites its application to preenactment events. That is evident from its ensuing discussion:
“It is true that in mere private cases between individuals, a court will and ought to struggle hard against a construction which will, by a retrospective operation, affect the rights of parties, but in great national concerns, where individual rights, acquired by war, are sacrificed for national purposes, the contract making the sacrifice ought always to receive a construction conforming to its manifest import; and if the nation has given up the vested rights of its citizens, it is not for the court, but for the government, to consider whether it be a **1582 case proper for compensation. In such a case the court must decide according to existing laws, and if it be necessary to set aside a judgment, rightful when rendered, but which cannot be affirmed but in violation of law, the judgment must be set aside.” Ibid.
 
As I have mentioned, Thorpe derived from Schooner Peggy the “general rule ... that an appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision.” 393 U.S., at 281, 89 S.Ct., at 526. Of course it does not stand for that at all—or at least not in the sense that Thorpe implied. It stands for the proposition that when Congress plainly says—contrary to the ordinary *847 presumption which courts will “struggle hard” to apply—that current law rather than the pre-existing law governs the rights of parties, then courts “must apply” that current law. That is in no way different from the rule applied in the generality of cases discussed in Part I of this opinion: If retroactive effect is explicit, retroactive effect is accorded.
 
Besides Schooner Peggy, the Thorpe opinion cited only four cases in support of the presumption of retroactivity. Two of them, Vandenbark v. Owens–Illinois Glass Co., 311 U.S. 538, 61 S.Ct. 347, 85 L.Ed. 327 (1941), and Carpenter v. Wabash R. Co., 309 U.S. 23, 60 S.Ct. 416, 84 L.Ed. 558 (1940), involved, like Schooner Peggy and Thorpe itself, a change of law that had occurred between the initial and the appellate decision. The third, United States v. Chambers, 291 U.S. 217, 54 S.Ct. 434, 78 L.Ed. 763 (1934), involved a change that had occurred after a criminal defendant had pleaded guilty but before judgment had been rendered. The fourth, Ziffrin, Inc. v. United States, 318 U.S. 73, 63 S.Ct. 465, 87 L.Ed. 621 (1943), involved a change that had occurred after application for a license had been made but before it had been ruled upon. In all four of these cases, the new law was adopted as the rule of decision. Once again, however, there was nothing in these decisions contrary to the normal rule of presumptive nonretroactivity of statutes described in Part I above. Vandenbark gave retroactive effect not to a statute but to a judicial decision, which is of course traditionally regarded as an expression of pre-existing law. See United States v. Security Industrial Bank, 459 U.S. 70, 79, 103 S.Ct. 407, 413, 74 L.Ed.2d 235 (1982) ( “The principle that statutes operate only prospectively, while judicial decisions operate retrospectively, is familiar to every law student”). Carpenter gave retroactive effect to a statute that (like the statute in Schooner Peggy ) on its face explicitly demanded retroactive effect. Chambers gave retroactive effect to the repeal of a criminal statute, which has always been an exception to the general rule that statutes are prospective, see n. 1, supra. The last case, Ziffrin, Inc. v. United States, supra, did not involve retroactive effect at all, but simply required the Interstate Commerce *848 Commission to apply current law (rather than the law in effect at the time of filing of the permit application) in determining whether the applicant was qualified to obtain a permit for future operations. The same result would have obtained in all of these cases if the change in law had occurred before the initial judicial decision, or before the initial step of the adjudicatory process.
 

B
The confusion that Thorpe introduced into this otherwise settled area of law was reinforced and perhaps expanded five years later, in Bradley v. Richmond School Bd., 416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974). There we held that a statute providing for the award of attorney’s fees, enacted while an appeal from the District Court’s award of fees was pending, had to be applied by the Court of Appeals. The opinion said:
“In the wake of Schooner Peggy, ... it remained unclear whether a change in the law occurring while a case was pending on appeal was to be given effect only where, by its terms, the law was to apply to **1583 pending cases, ... or, conversely, whether such a change in the law must be given effect unless there was clear indication that it was not to apply in pending cases. For a very long time the Court’s decisions did little to clarify this issue.
“Ultimately, in Thorpe v. Housing Authority of the City of Durham, ... the broader reading of Schooner Peggy was adopted, and this Court ruled that ‘an appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision.’ ...
“Accordingly, we must reject the contention that a change in the law is to be given effect in a pending case only where that is the clear and stated intention of the legislature.” Id., 416 U.S., at 712–715, 94 S.Ct., at 2016–2018 (footnote omitted).
 
The reason I say that Bradley perhaps expanded the confusion of Thorpe is not because of its holding. Whereas Thorpe could not possibly have come out the way it did under prior *849 law, Bradley probably would not, but might have. It is at least arguable that it does not constitute retroactive application to apply a provision dealing with the award of costs or fees in litigation to all litigation that has not yet terminated when the provision takes effect. But the reason I say that Bradley perhaps expanded the confusion of Thorpe is that its formulation of the governing principle was arguably more farreaching. The Thorpe formulation (“[A]n appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,” 393 U.S., at 281, 89 S.Ct., at 526 (emphasis added)) suggests that the rule of retroactivity applies only when the law has been changed between the initial and the appellate decision. The Bradley formulation (“[A] change in the law is to be given effect in a pending case” (emphasis added)) more naturally suggests that all judicial decisions must apply current law, no matter when the change occurred.
 
The cases relied upon by Bradley, however, see 416 U.S., at 712–713, n. 17, 94 S.Ct., at 2016–2017, n. 17, like the cases relied upon by Thorpe, all involve changes in law that occurred after an earlier stage of an adjudicatory proceeding—thus once again excluding from the relevant precedent the many cases I have alluded to in Part I setting forth the presumption of nonretroactivity. But also like the cases relied upon by Thorpe, not a single one of them is genuinely contrary to that generally applied presumption. They consist entirely of cases that involved retroactivity of judicial decisions rather than statutes (Moores v. National Bank, 104 U.S. 625, 26 L.Ed. 870 (1882); Dorchy v. Kansas, 264 U.S. 286, 44 S.Ct. 323, 68 L.Ed. 686 (1924); Sioux County v. National Surety Co., 276 U.S. 238, 48 S.Ct. 239, 72 L.Ed. 547 (1928); Patterson v. Alabama, 294 U.S. 600, 55 S.Ct. 575, 79 L.Ed. 1082 (1935); Vandenbark v. Owens–Illinois Glass Co., supra; cases in which the statute specifically provided for retroactive application (Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160, 162, 17 L.Ed. 922 (1865); Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, 174 U.S. 445, 477–478, 19 S.Ct. 722, 734, 43 L.Ed. 1041 (1899); Carpenter v. Wabash R. Co., supra, 309 U.S., at 27, 60 S.Ct., at 418; Dickinson Industrial Site, Inc. v. Cowan, 309 U.S. 382, 383, 60 S.Ct. 595, 596, 84 L.Ed. 819 (1940)); cases that involved prospective rather than retrospective application, because they *850 sought injunctive relief (Dinsmore v. Southern Express Co., 183 U.S. 115, 120, 22 S.Ct. 45, 46, 46 L.Ed. 111 (1901); United States v. Alabama, 362 U.S. 602, 80 S.Ct. 924, 4 L.Ed.2d 982 (1960) (per curiam )), because the issue was a permit for future action (Ziffrin, Inc. v. United States, 318 U.S. 73, 63 S.Ct. 465, 87 L.Ed. 621 (1943)), or because the issue was whether the United States’ declaration of war made it inappropriate for the trial court to continue with proceedings (Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca di Navigazione, 248 U.S. 9, 39 S.Ct. 1, 63 L.Ed. 100 (1918)); a case remanding to state court for its determination of the effect of a newly enacted state statute ( **1584 Missouri ex rel. Wabash R. Co. v. Public Service Comm’n, 273 U.S. 126, 47 S.Ct. 311, 71 L.Ed. 575 (1927)); and a case involving the special rule, see n. 1, supra, applicable to repeal of a criminal sanction (United States v. Chambers, 291 U.S. 217, 54 S.Ct. 434, 78 L.Ed. 763 (1934)).
 
It is significant that not a single one of the earlier cases cited in Thorpe and Bradley—except, of course, the cases dealing with judicial decisions rather than statutes and the case dealing with repeal of a criminal statute—even purports to be applying a presumption of retroactivity. They purport to be following the express command of the statute, or not to be acting retroactively at all. One of the cases, however, does mention as applicable to this (supposedly) special area of change-in-law-pending-appeal, the general presumption of non retroactivity applicable elsewhere:
“The contention is that the act of July 1, 1898, in extending the remedy by appeal to this court was invalid because retrospective, an invasion of the judicial domain, and destructive of vested rights. By its terms the act was to operate retrospectively, and as to that it may be observed that while the general rule is that statutes should be so construed as to give them only prospective operation, yet where the language employed expresses a contrary intention in unequivocal terms, the mere fact that the legislation is retroactive does not necessarily render it void.” Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, supra, 174 U.S., at 477–478, 19 S.Ct., at 734 (emphasis added).
 

*851 C
While Thorpe was the first case setting forth the presumption of retroactivity, and Bradley was the case expounding its supposed precedential basis in greatest detail, a number of other cases since Thorpe have referred to and (purportedly) applied the presumption, with citation of Thorpe, Bradley, or both, and sometimes with citation of one or more of the other cases (discussed above) cited in Bradley. These follow-on cases share two significant characteristics: First, all of them, like Thorpe and Bradley, involved a change in the law after the initial adjudication. Where the change has occurred prior to initial adjudication, we have made no mention of the Thorpe –Bradley presumption but, to the contrary, have discussed as though it was uncontroverted “[t]he principle that statutes operate only prospectively,” United States v. Security Industrial Bank, 459 U.S., at 79, 103 S.Ct., at 413—and (in seeming inconsistency with the analysis of Thorpe and Bradley ) have even quoted from Schooner Peggy to support that principle, 459 U.S., at 79–80, 103 S.Ct., at 413. Our most recent affirmation of the presumption of nonretroactivity (where the statute antedated initial adjudication) occurred last Term in Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital, 488 U.S., at 208, 109 S.Ct., at 471, where the following strong statement of the traditional rule was necessary to our unanimous decision:
“Retroactivity is not favored in the law. Thus, congressional enactments and administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result.... By the same principle, a statutory grant of legislative rulemaking authority will not, as a general matter, be understood to encompass the power to promulgate retroactive rules unless that power is conveyed by Congress in express terms.”
 
The second significant feature of the cases citing the Thorpe–Bradley presumption is that all of them would have come out the same way applying the pre-Thorpe law—for *852 reasons similar to those mentioned earlier in my discussion of the cases cited by Bradley. Most of them involved prospective rather than retrospective application, since they sought injunctive or declaratory relief. See Hall v. Beals, 396 U.S. 45, 48, 90 S.Ct. 200, 201, 24 L.Ed.2d 214 (1969); Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 417–419, 91 S.Ct. 814, 824–825, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971); **1585 Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist Church of Miami, Inc., 404 U.S. 412, 414, 92 S.Ct. 574, 575, 30 L.Ed.2d 567 (1972); California Bankers Assn. v. Shultz, 416 U.S. 21, 49, n. 21, 94 S.Ct. 1494, 1511, n. 21, 39 L.Ed.2d 812 (1974); Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 76–77, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 2086–2087, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975); Youakim v. Miller, 425 U.S. 231, 237, 96 S.Ct. 1399, 1402, 47 L.Ed.2d 701 (1976) (per curiam ); Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 663, 109 S.Ct. 1384, 1389, 103 L.Ed.2d 685 (1989). Some involved the retroactive effect of judicial decisions rather than statutes. See Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 102, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2899, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974); Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U.S. 473, 486, n. 16, 101 S.Ct. 2870, 2879, n. 16, 69 L.Ed.2d 784 (1981); Saint Francis College v. Al–Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604, 608, 107 S.Ct. 2022, 2025, 95 L.Ed.2d 582 (1987); Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 482 U.S. 656, 662, 107 S.Ct. 2617, 2621, 96 L.Ed.2d 572 (1987). And in one case we found explicit legislative indication of retroactive intent. See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 694–695, n. 23, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2575–2576, n. 23, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978).
 
In only one of the cases would Thorpe–Bradley have yielded a result different from the result produced by prior law—and there, significantly, we followed the prior law. Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U.S. 632, 105 S.Ct. 1555, 84 L.Ed.2d 572 (1985), was a suit by the Secretary of Education to recover from the State of New Jersey funds provided to it under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, Pub.L. 89–10, 79 Stat. 27, that had allegedly been used for ineligible programs. After the Department of Education’s administrative determination of misuse had been made, and a final determination letter demanding repayment had been issued, Title I was amended in a fashion which, the State alleged, would have validated its prior expenditures. Although this seemed to be a classic case for application of the Thorpe–Bradley presumption, we applied the opposite presumption instead. We distinguished Bradley on the ground that in the case before us “the Government’s right to recover any misused funds *853 preceded the 1978 Amendments.” 470 U.S., at 639, 105 S.Ct., at 1560. We quoted Bradley’s acknowledgment that there was an exception to its presumption for retroactive application that “ ‘would infringe upon or deprive a person of a right that had matured or become unconditional,’ ” ibid., quoting from 416 U.S., at 720, 94 S.Ct., at 2020, and noted that this “comports with another venerable rule of statutory interpretation, i.e., that statutes affecting substantive rights and liabilities are presumed to have only prospective effect.” 470 U.S., at 639, 105 S.Ct., at 1560. I would have thought that the language from Bradley referred to vested rights, which could not be retroactively eliminated without just compensation. By expanding the meaning of that limitation to include all “substantive rights and liabilities” we arguably deprived Bradley of its distinctive content, inasmuch as retroactive application is never sought (or defended against) except as a means of “affecting substantive rights and liabilities” at issue in the litigation. Even the purely procedural requirement of stating the reason for termination of a lease, which was at issue in Thorpe, affected the substantive right of the landlord to produce an effective termination of the lease and enforce an eviction. I suppose it would be possible to distinguish between statutes that alter “substantive rights and liabilities” directly, and those that do so only by retroactively adding a procedural requirement, the failure to comply with which alters the “substantive rights and liabilities”—but I fail to see the sense in such a distinction.

What the record shows, therefore is the following: (1) An unbroken line of precedent, prior to 1969, applying a presumption that statutes are not retroactive (except for repeal of penal provisions) in all cases. (2) In 1969, with Thorpe, a departure from that tradition **1586 (based upon a misreading of our precedent) for cases in which the statute has been enacted after initial adjudication. (3) From 1969 to the present, (a) firm adherence to the prior tradition in cases not involving *854 postadjudication enactment, and (b) the expression of adherence to the new presumption in postadjudication-enactment cases, but with only one case (Bradley, in 1974) where that probably produced a difference in outcome, and with one case (Bennett, in 1985) where it seemingly should have produced a difference in outcome but was not permitted to do so.
 
It is doubtful, on the basis of this record, whether the Thorpe–Bradley presumption of retroactivity survives at all. If it does, however, it only survives (as it was begotten) as a special rule applicable to changes in law after initial adjudication. That the traditional presumption of nonretroactivity continues to apply in all other cases is clear from our decisions in United States v. Security Industrial Bank, 459 U.S. 70, 103 S.Ct. 407, 74 L.Ed.2d 235 (1982), and Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988). The difficulty is, however, that it is quite impossible to apply the traditional presumption in “enactment-before-adjudication” cases and the Thorpe–Bradley presumption in “enactment-after-adjudication” cases, as a moment’s reflection will make plain. This would mean nonsuiting the plaintiff who has won a tort judgment that is on appeal when the statute abolishing the tort is enacted, while rendering judgment in favor of plaintiffs who sue later for preenactment torts. It would be irrational to produce these results.2
 
*855 In the last analysis, in other words, Thorpe and Bradley cannot avoid confronting the vast body of case law I have described in Part I of this opinion. It is ultimately not a question of dealing with the narrow category of “cases pending” or “cases on appeal” when the statute was enacted—as to which one might plausibly (though erroneously) say, as Bradley did, that “[f]or a very long time the Court’s decisions did little to clarify this issue.” 416 U.S., at 713, 94 S.Ct., at 2017. Rather, it is a question of adopting in all cases, and contrary to an immense volume of precedent, the presumption that statutes have retroactive effect. That unthinkable course was rejected, as recently as last Term, in Georgetown.
 
Precedent aside, however, even as an original matter there is nothing to be said for a presumption of retroactivity—neither in the narrow context of “cases pending” or “cases on appeal” nor (a fortiori ) in the logically compelled broader context of all cases. It is contrary to fundamental notions of justice, and thus contrary to realistic assessment of probable legislative intent. The principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and universal human appeal. It was recognized by the Greeks, see 2 P. Vinogradoff, Outlines of Historical Jurisprudence 139–140 (1922), by the Romans, see Justinian Code, Book 1, Title 14, § 7, by English common law, see 3 H. Bracton, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae 531 (T. Twiss trans. 1880); Smead, 20 Minn.L.Rev., at 776–778, and by the Code Napoleon, 1 Code Napoleon, Prelim. Title, Art. I, cl. 2 (B. Barrett trans. 1811). It has long been a solid foundation of American law. Chancellor Kent said that “it cannot be admitted that a statute shall, by any fiction or relation, have any effect before it was actually passed.” 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law * 455. Justice Story said that **1587 “retrospective laws are ... generally unjust; and ... neither accord with sound legislation nor with the fundamental principles of the social compact.” 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the *856 Constitution § 1398 (2d ed. 1851). The United States Constitution itself so far reflects these sentiments that it proscribes all retroactive application of punitive law, U.S. Const., Art. I, § 9, cl. 3; see Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798), and prohibits (or requires compensation for) all retroactive laws that destroy vested rights, see Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, 107 S.Ct. 2076, 95 L.Ed.2d 668 (1987); United States Trust Co. of N.Y. v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 1505, 52 L.Ed.2d 92 (1977). A provision of the New Hampshire Constitution, adopted in 1784 and still in effect, states: “Retrospective laws are highly injurious, oppressive, and unjust. No such laws, therefore, should be made, either for the decision of civil causes, or the punishment of offenses.” N.H. Const., Pt. 1, Art. 23. The Constitutions of other States also proscribe retroactive laws, see, e.g., Colo. Const., Art. II, § 11; Mont. Const., Art. XIII, § 1, cl. 3; Ohio Const., Art. II, § 28, and the codes of some States contain a provision specifying that all laws are to be applied prospectively unless a contrary intent (of varying specificity) appears. See, e.g., N.Y. Statutes Law § 51b (McKinney 1971) (“unless the language of the statute either expressly or by necessary implication requires ... retroactive construction”); Pa.Stat.Ann., Tit. 46, § 556 (Purdon 1969) (“when clearly and manifestly so intended by the Legislature”). The presumption of nonretroactivity, in short, gives effect to enduring notions of what is fair, and thus accords with what legislators almost always intend.
 
The Thorpe–Bradley rule does the opposite, as the peculiar preannounced exception to its application makes clear. A background rule of retroactivity is so patently contrary to probable legislative intent that it could not possibly be applied (as the presumption of non retroactivity is applied) whenever there is no legislative indication to the contrary. So Thorpe and Bradley have invented an all-purpose exception to their counterintuitive rule: retroactivity will not be assumed where that will produce “manifest injustice.” What that might mean (viz., almost anything) is well enough exemplified by Thorpe. There we did not consider it “manifestlyunjust,” *857 on the basis of a federal regulation adopted 18 months after the fact, to prevent a landlord from evicting a tenant whose lease had been terminated in full compliance (as we assumed) with all applicable laws. Is there any doubt that we would have found it “manifestly unjust” to evict the tenant if the sequence were reversed—that is, if the landlord had not complied, at the time of lease termination, with a regulation repealed 18 months later? “Manifest injustice,” I fear, is just a surrogate for policy preferences. Indeed, it cannot be otherwise. Once one begins from the premise of Thorpe and Bradley that, contrary to the wisdom of the ages, it is not in and of itself unjust to judge action on the basis of a legal rule that was not even in effect when the action was taken, then one is not really talking about “justice” at all, but about mercy, or compassion, or social utility, or whatever other policy motivation might make one favor a particular result. A rule of law, designed to give statutes the effect Congress intended, has thus been transformed to a rule of discretion, giving judges power to expand or contract the effect of legislative action. We should turn this frog back to a prince as soon as possible.

I do not pretend that clear reaffirmation of the presumption of nonretroactivity will always make it simple to determine the application in time of new legislation. It will remain difficult, in many cases, to decide whether the presumption has been overcome by text, and indeed to decide whether a **1588 particular application is retroactive.3 But however *858 many obstacles may remain along the route, surely it is essential to agree upon our point of departure. The Thorpe–Bradley presumption of retroactivity, which is arguably formulated to apply to a relatively narrow class of cases but which logically must be extended across the board, misleads prospective litigants and confuses judges of the lower courts. I would say that it confuses even Congress itself—except that I believe and hope that legislators choose their language with the assumptions that just men and women normally entertain, rather than the assumptions derived from consulting the latest decision of this Court.
 
I would eliminate the confusion of the past two decades and reaffirm unqualifiedly the principle of construction that reflects both our long applied jurisprudence and the reality of legislative intent: A statute is deemed to be effective only for the future unless contrary intent appears.

I limit the expression of the rule to nonpenal legislation because a contrary presumption (i.e., a presumption of retroactivity) is applied to the repeal of punishments.
“[I]t has been long settled, on general principles, that after the expiration or repeal of a law, no penalty can be enforced, nor punishment inflicted, for violations of the law committed while it was in force, unless some special provision be made for that purpose by statute.” Yeaton v. United States, 5 Cranch 281, 283, 3 L.Ed. 101 (1809).
See also United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88, 95, 20 L.Ed. 153 (1871) ( “There can be no legal conviction, nor any valid judgment pronounced upon conviction, unless the law creating the offence be at the time in existence”). For convenience' sake, in the remainder of this opinion I will generally omit this qualification in my expression of the rule.

Perhaps it would be rational to do the opposite—that is, to say that acts which have been initially adjudicated, like acts which have been finally adjudicated and thus placed beyond the reach of the new statute by the doctrine of res judicata, will not be affected by a new law, even when acts not yet adjudicated are affected. The possibility of such special treatment perhaps explains why judges feel it necessary to discuss cases involving amendment pending appeal as a separate category: not in order to establish that a special rule of retroactivity applies to them, but to make clear that when the generally applicable presumption of nonretroactivity has been rebutted by the text of the statute, the then-ensuing general retroactivity of the statute will apply to those cases, just as it does to matters not yet in litigation.
3
The latter difficulty inheres to some degree in the present case. Arguably it would not be giving retroactive effect to a new statutory interest rate for judgments if one applied that rate to all outstanding balances on judgments, with respect to all periods of time after the statute's effective date—regardless of when the judgments were rendered. It depends upon what one considers to be the determinative event by which retroactivity or prospectivity is to be calculated. If it is the entry of judgment, then only judgments rendered after the effective date will be covered by prospective application; but if it is the day-by-day assessment of interest against an owing sum, then judgments rendered before the effective date will be affected as well, but only with respect to interest calculated after the effective date. Thus, what is covered by prospective application would have been a different question in the present case if the new interest rate set by the statute were a fixed, flat percentage for the entire term of the judgment debt, or even a percentage that varied from month to month over the term to comport with some varying external reference. In fact, however, the rate here is a fixed percentage for the entire term, calculated on the basis of the rate provided by a varying external reference at or near the time of judgment. This suggests to me that Congress was addressing future judgments, rather than future days on which interest is owing. The application of the presumption, like the presumption itself, seeks to ascertain the probable legislative intent.
