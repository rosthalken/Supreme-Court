I agree with the Court's textual analysis of 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3) (1988 ed., Supp. V), and think that analysis sufficient to resolve this case. I agree with JUSTICE KENNEDY that the Court's discussions of § 3583(a), ante, at 13-14, and § 3583(e)(2), ante, at 18, are unnecessary to the result. I would not rely, as the Court (ante, at 14-15) and JUSTICE KENNEDY (ante, at 2) do, on any apparent congressional purpose supporting the Court's reading of § 3583(e)(3). With these observations, I concur in the judgment.
