Supreme Court of the United States
OHIO, Petitioner
v.
Darius CLARK.
No. 13–1352.

Argued March 2, 2015.

Decided June 18, 2015.
Justice THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.

I agree with the Court that Ohio mandatory reporters are not agents of law enforcement, that statements made to private persons or by very young children will rarely implicate the Confrontation Clause, and that the admission of the statements at issue here did not implicate that constitutional provision. I nonetheless cannot join the majority’s analysis. In the decade since we first sought to return to the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause, see Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), we have carefully reserved consideration of that Clause’s application to statements made to private persons for a case in which it was squarely presented. See, e.g., Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U.S. 344, 357, n. 3, 131 S.Ct. 1143, 179 L.Ed.2d 93 (2011).
 
This is that case; yet the majority does not offer clear guidance on the subject, declaring only that “the primary purpose test is a necessary, but not always sufficient, condition” for a statement to fall within the scope of the Confrontation Clause. Ante, at 2180 – 2181. The primary purpose test, however, is just as much “an exercise in fiction ... disconnected from history” for statements made to private persons as it is for statements made to agents of law enforcement, if not more so. See Bryant, supra, at 379, 131 S.Ct. 1143 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted). I would not apply it here. Nor would I leave the resolution of this important question in doubt.
 
*2186 Instead, I would use the same test for statements to private persons that I have employed for statements to agents of law enforcement, assessing whether those statements bear sufficient indicia of solemnity to qualify as testimonial. See Crawford, supra, at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354; Davis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 836–837, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). This test is grounded in the history of the common-law right to confrontation, which “developed to target particular practices that occurred under the English bail and committal statutes passed during the reign of Queen Mary, namely, the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.” Id., at 835, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (internal quotation marks omitted). Reading the Confrontation Clause in light of this history, we have interpreted the accused’s right to confront “the witnesses against him,” U.S. Const., Amdt. 6, as the right to confront those who “bear testimony” against him, Crawford, 541 U.S., at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (relying on the ordinary meaning of “witness”). And because “[t]estimony ... is ... a solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact,” ibid. (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted), an analysis of statements under the Clause must turn in part on their solemnity, Davis, supra, at 836, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).
 
I have identified several categories of extrajudicial statements that bear sufficient indicia of solemnity to fall within the original meaning of testimony. Statements “contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions” easily qualify. White v. Illinois, 502 U.S. 346, 365, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). And statements not contained in such materials may still qualify if they were obtained in “a formalized dialogue”; after the issuance of the warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); while in police custody; or in an attempt to evade confrontation. Davis, supra, at 840, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); see also Bryant, 562 U.S., at 379, 131 S.Ct. 1143 (same) (summarizing and applying test). That several of these factors seem inherently inapplicable to statements made to private persons does not mean that the test is unsuitable for analyzing such statements. All it means is that statements made to private persons rarely resemble the historical abuses that the common-law right to confrontation developed to address, and it is those practices that the test is designed to identify.
 
Here, L.P.’s statements do not bear sufficient indicia of solemnity to qualify as testimonial. They were neither contained in formalized testimonial materials nor obtained as the result of a formalized dialogue initiated by police. Instead, they were elicited during questioning by L.P.’s teachers at his preschool. Nor is there any indication that L.P.’s statements were offered at trial to evade confrontation. To the contrary, the record suggests that the prosecution would have produced L.P. to testify had he been deemed competent to do so. His statements bear no “resemblance to the historical practices that the Confrontation Clause aimed to eliminate.” Ibid. The admission of L.P.’s extrajudicial statements thus does not implicate the Confrontation Clause.
 
I respectfully concur in the judgment.
