
This case presents the question whether, after a defendant pleads guilty or is convicted, the Sixth Amendment permits defense counsel simply to walk away, leaving the defendant uncounseled about his appeal rights. The Court is not     deeply divided on this question. Both the Court and JUSTICE SOUTER effectively    respond: hardly ever. Because    the test articulated by JUSTICE SOUTER provides clearer guidance to lower courts and to counsel, and because I think it plain that the duty to consult was not satisfied in this case, I join JUSTICE SOUTER's opinion.
