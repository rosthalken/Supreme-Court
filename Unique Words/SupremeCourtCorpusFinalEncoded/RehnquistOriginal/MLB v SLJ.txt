Supreme Court of the United States
M. L. B., Petitioner,
v.
S. L. J., Individually and as Next Friend of the Minor Children, S. L. J. and M. L. J., et ux.
No. 95–853.

Argued Oct. 7, 1996.

Decided Dec. 16, 1996.
 

Chief Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting.

I join all but Part II of Justice THOMAS’ dissenting opinion. For the reasons stated in that opinion, I would not extend the Griffin–Mayer line of cases to invalidate Mississippi’s refusal to pay for petitioner’s transcript on appeal in this case.
