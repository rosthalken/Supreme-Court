
Congress has authorized citizen suits to enforce the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. § 11001 et seq. Does that authorization, as Congress designed it, permit citizen suits for    wholly past violations? For the reasons stated by JUSTICE STEVENS in Part III of his opinion, I agree that the answer is "No." I would follow the path this Court marked in Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U.S. 49, 60-61, 98 L. Ed. 2d 306, 108 S. Ct. 376 (1987), and resist expounding or offering advice on the constitutionality of what Congress might have done, but did not do.
