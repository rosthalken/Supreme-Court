JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring.

I concur fully in the opinion and judgment of the Court. I write separately to note that this case [****22]  involves a denial of prison access to particular visitors, not a general ban on all prison visitation. Nothing in the Court's opinion forecloses the claim that a prison regulation permanently forbidding all visits to some or all prisoners implicates the protections of the Due Process Clause in a way that the precise and individualized restrictions at issue here do not.
