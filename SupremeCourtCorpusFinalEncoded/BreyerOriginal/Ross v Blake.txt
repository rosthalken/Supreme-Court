JUSTICE Breyer, concurring in part.

I join the opinion of the Court, with the exception that I described in  [*1863] Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 126 S. Ct. 2378, 165 L. Ed. 2d 368 (2006). There, I agreed that “Congress intended the term ‘exhausted’ to ‘mean what the term means in administrative law, where exhaustion means proper exhaustion.’”  [***29] Id., at 103, 126 S. Ct. 2378, 165 L. Ed. 2d 368 (opinion concurring in judgment). Though that statutory term does not encompass “freewheeling” exceptions for any “‘special circumstanc[e],’” ante, at ___, 136 S. Ct. 1850, 195 L. Ed. 2d, at 122, it does include administrative law’s “well-established exceptions to exhaustion.” Woodford, supra, at 103, 126 S. Ct. 2378, 165 L. Ed. 2d 368 (opinion of Breyer, J.). I believe that such exceptions, though not necessary to the Court’s disposition of this case, may nevertheless apply where appropriate.
