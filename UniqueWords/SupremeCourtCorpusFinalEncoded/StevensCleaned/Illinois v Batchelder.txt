
This case comes to us from an intermediate Illinois appellate court. It is a case that the Illinois Supreme Court declined to review. Its practical consequences concern the amount of detail that Illinois police officers in the Third Appellate District must include in an affidavit supporting a petition to suspend a driver's license. In final analysis the only question presented relates to how an Illinois statute is to be implemented in one part of the State. I suspect that the Illinois Supreme Court may have decided not to take this case because it preferred to address the question presented in a case in which both parties would be adequately represented.

The only paper filed in behalf of the losing party in this Court reads, in full, as follows:

Court Clerk;

Re: Illinois vs: Milton D. Batchelder

No: 82-947

In regard to your letter of 3-31-83 pertaining to the above captioned    matter.

    I have a heart problem and am unemployed.

I do not have the funds to hire an attorney.

Is it possible for the court to appoint me counsel or for the court to rule on the record that is on appeal?

I am unlearned at law and have had little formal education.

Unless the court can give me some help I will not be able to pursue this matter.

/s/ Milton Batchelder

If a case is important enough to merit a decision on the merits by this Court, I believe it also should be important enough to justify the appointment of counsel to represent the party defending the judgment of the court below. I respectfully dissent from the Court's summary disposition.
