Supreme Court of the United States
Joseph ANZA, et al., Petitioners,
v.
IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.
No. 04–433.
|
Argued March 27, 2006.
|
Decided June 5, 2006.
 

Justice SCALIA, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court. I also note that it is inconceivable that the injury alleged in the 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) claim at issue here is within the zone of interests protected by the RICO cause of action for fraud perpetrated upon New York State. See Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U.S. 258, 286–290, 112 S.Ct. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).
