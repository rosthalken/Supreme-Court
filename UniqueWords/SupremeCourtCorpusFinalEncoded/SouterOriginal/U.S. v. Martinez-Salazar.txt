UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ABEL MARTINEZ-SALAZAR

No. 98-1255

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

120 S. Ct. 774

November 29, 1999, Argued 
January 19, 2000, Decided

JUSTICE SOUTER, concurring.
I concur in the opinion of the Court. I write only to suggest that this case does not present the issue whether it is reversible error to refuse to afford a defendant a peremptory challenge beyond the maximum otherwise allowed, when he has used a peremptory challenge to cure an erroneous denial of a challenge for cause and when he shows that he would  [*318]  otherwise use his full complement of peremptory challenges for the noncurative purposes that are the focus of the peremptory right. Martinez-Salazar did not show that, if he had not used his peremptory challenge curatively, he would have used it peremptorily against another juror. He did not ask for a make-up peremptory or object to any juror who sat. Martinez-Salazar simply made a choice to use his peremptory challenge curatively.
