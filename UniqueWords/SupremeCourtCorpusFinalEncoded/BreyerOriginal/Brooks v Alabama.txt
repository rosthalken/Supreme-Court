JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting from denial of application for stay of execution and petition for certiorari.

Christopher Eugene Brooks was sentenced to death in accordance with Alabama’s procedures, which allow a jury to render an “advisory verdict” that “is not binding on the court.” Ala. Code §13A-5-47(e) (2006). For the reasons explained in my opinions concurring in the judgment in Hurst v. Florida, ante, at 1, 577 U.S. ___, 2016 U.S. LEXIS 619, and Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 613-619, 122 S. Ct. 2428, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556 (2002), and my dissenting opinion in Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U. S. 348, 358-366, 124 S. Ct. 2519, 159 L. Ed. 2d 442 (2004), I dissent from the order of the Court to deny the application [***2]  for stay of execution and the petition for a writ of certiorari.

Moreover, we have recognized that Alabama’s sentencing scheme is “much like” and “based on Florida’s sentencing scheme.” Harris v. Alabama, 513 U. S. 504, 508, 115 S. Ct. 1031, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1004 (1995). Florida’s scheme is unconstitutional. See Hurst, ante, at 1, 577 U.S. ___, 2016 U.S. LEXIS 619 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). The unfairness inherent in treating this case differently from others which used similarly unconstitutional procedures only underscores the need to reconsider the validity of capital punishment under the Eighth Amendment. See Glossip v. Gross, 576 U. S. ___, ___, 135 S. Ct. 2726, 192 L. Ed. 2d 761, 815-816 (2015) (BREYER, J., dissenting). I respectfully dissent.
