While I join the Court's opinion, I do so on the understanding that its reference to "good cause" for failing to exhaust state remedies more promptly, ante, at 277, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 452, is not intended to impose the sort of strict and inflexible requirement that would "'trap the unwary pro se prisoner.'" Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 520, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (1982); see also Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 487, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542, 120 S. Ct. 1595 (2000).
