Thornton, 514 U.S. 779, 846, 115 S.Ct. 1842, 131 L.Ed.2d 881 (1995) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). For this reason, I disagree with the Court’s premise, derived from U.S. Term Limits, that the States have no authority to regulate congressional elections except for the authority that the Constitution expressly delegates to them. See ante, at 1037–1038. Nonetheless, the parties conceded the validity of this premise, see Brief for Petitioner 25–26; Brief for Respondents 12–13, and I therefore concur.
