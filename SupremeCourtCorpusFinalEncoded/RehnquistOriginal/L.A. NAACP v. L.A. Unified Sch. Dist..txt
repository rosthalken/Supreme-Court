1981 U.S. LEXIS 242
LOS ANGELES NAACP, ET AL., Petitioners V. LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, ET AL.
Supreme Court of the United States
April 21, 1981
No. A-875

JUSTICE REHNQUIST, CIRCUIT JUSTICE.
I cannot but share the views of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit with respect to the dilemma which all of the parties find themselves at this stage of this prolonged litigation. Much as it would be desirable for me as Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit to act immediately upon applicants' request for a stay, I find that I cannot, in the proper discharge of my judicial duties, act without benefit of a response from the respondents.  [*2]  Therefore, without either granting or denying the applicants' request, I request respondents to file a response to the application for a stay by 5 p.m. P.S.T., Wednesday, April 22, 1981.
Meanwhile, the order of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacating the order issued by the District Court, and allowing respondent Los Angeles Unified School District to implement its proposed plan, shall remain in effect.
So ordered.
