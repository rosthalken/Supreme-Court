Supreme Court of the United States
Mohamed Ali SAMANTAR, Petitioner,
v.
Bashe Abdi YOUSUF et al.
No. 08–1555.
|
Argued March 3, 2010.
|
Decided June 1, 2010.
 
Justice THOMAS, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

I join the Court’s opinion except for those parts relying on the legislative history of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330, 1602, et seq. In my view, the Court’s textual analysis is sufficient to resolve this case. See post, at 2293 – 2294 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).
