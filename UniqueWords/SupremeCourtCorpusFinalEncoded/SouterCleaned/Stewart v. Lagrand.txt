I join Part I of the Per Curiam Opinion, on the understanding that petitioner makes no claim that death by lethal    injection would be cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment. I do not reach any issue of the applicability of Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334, 109 S. Ct. 1060 (1989).
