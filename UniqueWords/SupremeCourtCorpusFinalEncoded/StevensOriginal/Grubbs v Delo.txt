GRUBBS, RICKY L., PETITIONER V. DELO, SUPERINTENDENT, POTOSI CORRECTIONAL CENTER

92-6303 (A-324)

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

506 U.S. 947

October 21, 1992, Decided 

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
For me, the respondent's failure to file a motion to vacate the stay entered by Justice Blackmun is a sufficient reason for allowing that stay to remain in effect. Moreover, if such a motion were filed, I would vote to deny it because I do not believe the petition for certiorari should be acted upon before the Court decides the pending case of Herrera v. Collins, No. 91-7328.
