505 U.S. 42
GEORGIA, PETITIONER v. THOMAS McCOLLUM, WILLIAM JOSEPH McCOLLUM AND ELLA HAMPTON MCCOLLUM
Supreme Court of the United States
February 26, 1992, Argued ; June 18, 1992, Decided
No. 91-372

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concurring.
I was in dissent in Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614, 114 L. Ed. 2d 660, 111 S. Ct. 2077 (1991), and continue to believe that case to have been wrongly decided. But so long as it remains the law, I believe that it controls the disposition of this case on the  [*60]  issue of "state action" under the Fourteenth Amendment. I therefore join the opinion of the Court.
