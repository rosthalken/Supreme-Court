MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST joins, concurring.

In my judgment the record not only supports the conclusion that Gilmore was competent to waive [****7]  his right to appeal, but also makes it clear that his access to the courts is entirely unimpeded and therefore a third party has no standing to litigate an Eighth Amendment claim - or indeed any other claim - on his behalf. Without a proper litigant before it, this Court is without power to stay the execution.
