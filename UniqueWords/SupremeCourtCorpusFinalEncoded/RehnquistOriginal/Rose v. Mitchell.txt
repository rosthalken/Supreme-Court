443 U.S. 545
ROSE, WARDEN v. MITCHELL ET AL.
Supreme Court of the United States
January 16, 1979, Argued ; July 2, 1979, Decided
No. 77-1701



MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concurring in part.
I fully agree with, and have joined, the separate opinions of my Brothers STEWART and POWELL concurring in the judgment in this case. For the separate reasons they state, neither of them would reach the merits of the claim of grand jury discrimination which the Court decides. Since, however, a majority of the Court rejects these views, I join Parts I, III, and IV of the Court's opinion.
