Supreme Court of the United States
Thomas VAN ORDEN, Petitioner,
v.
Rick PERRY, in his official capacity as Governor of Texas and Chairman, State Preservation Board, et al.
No. 03-1500.

Argued March 2, 2005.

Decided June 27, 2005.
 

Justice SCALIA, concurring.

I join the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE because I think it accurately reflects our current Establishment Clause jurisprudence-or at least the Establishment Clause jurisprudence we currently apply some of the time. I would prefer to reach the same result by adopting an Establishment Clause jurisprudence that is in accord with our Nation’s past and present practices, and that can be consistently applied-the central relevant feature of which is that there is nothing unconstitutional in a State’s favoring religion generally, honoring God through public prayer and acknowledgment, or, in a nonproselytizing manner, venerating the Ten Commandments. See McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., ante, 545 U.S., at 885-894, 125 S.Ct. 2722, 2727-2732, 162 L.Ed.2d 729, 2005 WL 1498988 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).
