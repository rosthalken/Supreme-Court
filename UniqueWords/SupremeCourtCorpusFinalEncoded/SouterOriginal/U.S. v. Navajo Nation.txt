UNITED STATES, Petitioner v. NAVAJO NATION

No. 07-1410

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

129 S. Ct. 1547

February 23, 2009, Argued 
April 6, 2009, Decided

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens joins, concurring.
I am not through regretting that my position in United States v. Navajo Nation, 537 U.S. 488, 514-521, 123 S. Ct. 1079, 155 L. Ed. 2d 60 (2003) (dissenting opinion), did not carry the day. But it did not, and I agree that the precedent of that case calls for the result reached here.
