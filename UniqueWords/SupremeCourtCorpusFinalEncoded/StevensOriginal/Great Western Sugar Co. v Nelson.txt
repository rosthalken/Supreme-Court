MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
If we have time to grant certiorari for the sole purpose of correcting a highly technical and totally harmless error, one might reasonably (but incorrectly) infer that we have more than enough time to dispatch our more important business.

I would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.
