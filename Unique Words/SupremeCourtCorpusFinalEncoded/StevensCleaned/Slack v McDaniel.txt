With respect to the issue resolved in Part II of the Court's opinion, I agree with the Courts of Appeals that have held that the pre-AEDPA version of 28 U.S.C. § 2253 governs the right to appeal with respect to an appeal noticed after the effective date of AEDPA in a habeas corpus proceeding commenced prior to that date. See Fuller v. Roe, 182 F.3d 699, 702 (CA9 1999); Crowell v. Walsh, 331 U.S. App. D.C. 376, 151 F.3d 1050, 1051-1052 (CADC 1998); Tejeda v. Dubois, 142 F.3d 18, 22, n. 4 (CA1 1998); Berrios v. United States, 126 F.3d 430, 431, n. 2 (CA2 1997); United States v. Kunzman, 125 F.3d 1363, 1364, n. 2 (CA10 1997); United States v. Skandier, 125 F.3d 178, 179-182 (CA3 1997); Hardwick v. Singletary,    122 F.3d 935, 936, vacated in part on other grounds, 126 F.3d 1312 (CA11 1997); Arredondo v. United States, 120 F.3d 639, 640 (CA6 1997); United States v. Carter, 117 F.3d 262, 264 (CA5 1997); but see Tiedeman v. Benson, 122 F.3d 518, 520-521 (CA8 1997).
I do, however, join the balance of the Court's opinion and its judgment.
