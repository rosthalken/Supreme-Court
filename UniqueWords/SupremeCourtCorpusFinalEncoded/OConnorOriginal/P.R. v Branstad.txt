JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE POWELL joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

I join Parts I, II-A, II-C, and III of the Court's opinion. Because the Court ultimately resolves this case under the  [*231]  Extradition Act, 18 U. S. C. § 3182, I do not find Part II-B, and its statements concerning the Extradition Clause of the Constitution, necessary to the decision of this  [**2810]  case. Accordingly, I do not subscribe to that part of the Court's opinion. See, e. g., Jean v. Nelson, 472 U.S. 846, 854 (1985); Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 361, n. 10 (1983); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).
