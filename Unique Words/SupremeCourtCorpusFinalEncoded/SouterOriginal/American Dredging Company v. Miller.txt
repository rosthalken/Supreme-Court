AMERICAN DREDGING COMPANY, PETITIONER v. WILLIAM ROBERT MILLER

No. 91-1950

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

114 S. Ct. 981

November 9, 1993, Argued 
February 23, 1994, Decided

JUSTICE SOUTER, concurring.
I join in the opinion of the Court because I agree that in most cases the characterization of a state rule as substantive  [*458]  or procedural will be a sound surrogate for the conclusion that would follow from a more discursive pre-emption analysis. The distinction between substance and procedure will, however, sometimes be obscure. As to those close cases, how a given rule is characterized for purposes of determining whether federal maritime law pre-empts state law will turn on whether the state rule unduly interferes with the federal interest in maintaining the free flow of maritime commerce.
