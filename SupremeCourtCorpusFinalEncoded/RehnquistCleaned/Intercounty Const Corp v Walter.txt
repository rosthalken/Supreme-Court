 
Section 22 was first enacted as part of the original Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act in 1927. 44 Stat. 1424—1446. As petitioners concede, the provision as originally drafted applied only to the modification of orders previously entered by the deputy commissioner:

‘Modification of Awards
‘Sec. 22. Upon his own initiative, or upon application of any party in interest, on the ground of a change in conditions, the deputy commissioner may at any time during the term of an award and after the compensation order in respect of such award has become final, review such order in accordance with the procedure prescribed in respect of claims in section 19, and in accordance with such section issue a new compensation order which may terminate, continue, increase, or decrease such compensation. Such new order shall not affect any compensation paid under authority of the prior order.’ Id., at 1437.
 
As originally adopted, s 22 provided power to the deputy commissioner to **2021 modify a prior order only ‘during the term of an award’ and the provision was construed to constrict the power to modify a previous order to the period of payments pursuant to an award. Cf. *9 F. Jarka Co. v. Monahan, 29 F.2d 741, 742 (Mass.1928). The United States Employees’ Compensation Commission (USECC), then charged with the administration of the Act, repeatedly recommended that s 22 be amended to allow continuing review of previously entered orders. 14th Ann.Rep. USECC 75 (1930); 15th Ann.Rep. USECC 77 (1931); 16th Ann.Rep. USECC 49 (1932); 17th Ann.Rep. USECC 18 (1933). See Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers, 390 US. 459, 463—465, 88 S.Ct. 1140, 1143—1144, 20 L.Ed.2d 30 (1968). In none of the annual reports of the USECC is there any indication that amendment of this provision was sought for any purpose other than broadening the length of time during which the deputy commissioner could exercise his power to modify previously entered orders.
In 1934 Congress responded by amending this provision to read:

‘Modification of Compensation Cases
‘Sec. 22. Upon his own initiative, or upon the application of any party in interest, on the ground of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact by the deputy commissioner, the deputy commissioner may, at any time prior to one year after the date of the last payment of compensation, whether or not a compensation order has been issued, review a compensation case in accordance with the procedure prescribed in respect of claims in section 19, and in accordance with such section issue a new compensation order which may terminate, continue, reinstate, increase, or decrease such compensation. Such new order shall not affect any compensation previously paid, except that an award increasing the compensation rate may be made effective from the date of the injury, and if any part of the compensation due or to become due *10 is unpaid, an award decreasing the compensation rate may be made effective from the date of the injury, and any payment made prior thereto in excess of such decreased rate shall be deducted from any unpaid compensation, in such manner and by such method as may be determined by the deputy commissioner with the approval of the commission.’ 48 Stat. 807.
 
This amendment inserted the phrase ‘whether or not a compensation order has been issued,’ the phrase upon which the petitioners’ statutory claim rests, and they naturally urge that it was intended to apply the one-year time limit of s 22, formerly applicable only to the modification of previously entered orders, to all pending claims. But the legislative history does not bear out petitioners’ contention.
[2] The committee reports of both Houses of Congress accompanying this change explain it in the following language:
‘(This bill) amends section 22 of the existing act so as to broaden the grounds on which a deputy commissioner can modify an award and also while strictly limiting the period, extends the time within which such modification may be made. . . .
 
‘The amendment is in line with the recommendation of the (USECC) except that it limits to 1 year after the date of the last payment of compensation the time during which such modification may be made.’ S.Rep.No.588, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 3—4 (1934); H.R.Rep.No.1244, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 4 (1934).
 
As we similarly stated in Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers, supra, at 464, 88 S.Ct., at 1144: ‘The purpose of this amendment was to ‘broaden the grounds on which a deputy commissioner can modify an award.‘‘ See, e.g., *11 **2022 O’Keeffe v. AerojetGeneral Shipyards, 404 U.S. 254, 255—256, 92 S.Ct. 405, 406—407, 30 L.Ed.2d 424 (1971). There is no indication that Congress sought by this amendment to superimpose a new statute of limitations, in addition to the required period for filing provided by s 13, on all claims filed under the Act upon which payments are made. Taken in historical and statutory context, the phrase ‘whether or not a compensation order has been issued’ is properly interpreted to mean merely that the one-year time limit imposed on the power of the deputy commissioner to modify existing orders runs from the date of final payment of compensation even if the order sought to be modified is actually entered only after such date.
 
Section 22 was amended in 1983 to read as it presently does. 52 Stat. 1167. The chief change was permitting the deputy commissioner to review a case ‘at any time prior to one year after the rejection of a claim.’ Such amendment would have been largely superfluous if Congress in 1934 had already extended this provision to cover claims whether or not previously disposed of by the deputy commissioner. And in fact the legislative history surrounding the 1938 amendment reveals a clear congressional understanding that s 22 applied only to modification of prior orders of the deputy commissioner. Thus, for example, the House Report accompanying the 1938 Amendment stated that ‘(t)he purpose of this amendment is to extend to such cases the same provisions which now apply in connection with other cases finally acted upon by the deputy commissioner.’ H.R.Rep.No.1945, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., 9 (1938). (Emphasis added.) See also H.R.Rep.No.1807, 74th Cong. 1st Sess., 5 (1935); S.Rep.No.1199, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1935); H.R.Rep.No.2237, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., 5 (1936); S.Rep.No.1988, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., 8—9 (1938). Regulations issued under the Act by the USECC, *12 contemporaneously with passage of the 1938 amendment, reflect an administrative understanding that s 22 governed ‘application(s) to the deputy commissioner for review of a compensation case for modification of an award.’ 20 CFR s 31.15 (1938); 20 CFR s 31.16 (1949).
The Fifth Circuit in Strachan Shipping Co. v. Hollis, supra, indicated its belief that the absence of a procedure for orderly conclusion of compensation cases was incompatible with a scheme of cooperation and voluntary payments by employers and insurers envisaged by the Act. 460 F.2d, at 1116. The court below disagreed, indicating its belief that the present procedures giving a carrier the right to compel the deputy commissioner to adjudicate claims eliminate any unfairness which might result from the absence of a fixed conclusion to such cases. 163 U.S.App.D.C., at 152, 500 F.2d, at 820. Cf. 33 U.S.C. s 919(c); 5 U.S.C. s 706(1); Atlantic & Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Donovan, 274 F.2d 794 (CA5 1960). Whatever the merits of a fixed period for resolution of pending compensation claims not previously the subject of an order, Congress did not in s 22 establish such a period. The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is therefore affirmed.
Affirmed.

In 1972, this reponsibility was transferred to the Office of Workmen's Compensation Programs of the Department of Labor. See 20 CFR ss 701.101—701.103 (1973).

The District of Columbia Workmen's Compensation Act incorporates by reference the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. s 901 et seq. as amended. See D.C.Code Ann. s 36—501 (1973).

Section 13 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. s 913, provided in part:
‘The right to compensation for disability under this chapter shall be barred unless a claim therefor is filed within one year after the injury . . . except that if payment of compensation has been made without an award on account of such injury . . . a claim may be filed within one year after the date of the last payment. . . .’
Section 12 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. s 912 (1970 ed. and Supp. III), requires the employee to give notice of injury unless the employer has actual notice of the injury.
4
Since the Act requires the employer to begin making the payments called for by the Act within 14 days after receiving notice of injury without awaiting resolution of the compensation claim and permits withholding of payments only to the extent of any dispute, voluntary payment in advance of an actual order is common under the Act. See s 14 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. s 914 (1970 ed. and Supp. III). Either party may obtain resolution of a pending claim by request under s 19(c) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. s 919(c), but in practice many pending claims are amicably settled through voluntary payments without the necessity of a formal order by the deputy commissioner.
