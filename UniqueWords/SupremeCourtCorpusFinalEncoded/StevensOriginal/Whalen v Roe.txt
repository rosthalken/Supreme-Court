[*591]  [***68]  [**872]  MR. JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.

LEdHN[1A] [1A]LEdHN[2A] [2A]LEdHN[3A] [3A]The constitutional question presented is whether the State of New York may record, in a centralized computer file, the names and addresses of all persons who have obtained, pursuant to a doctor's prescription, certain drugs for which there is both a lawful and an unlawful market.

The District Court enjoined enforcement of the portions of the New York State Controlled Substances Act of 1972 1Link to the text of the note [****6]  which require such recording on the ground that they violate appellees' constitutionally protected rights of privacy. 2Link to the text of the note We noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal by the Commissioner of Health, 424 U.S. 907, and now reverse. 3Link to the text of the note

Many drugs have both legitimate and illegitimate uses. In response to a concern that such drugs were being diverted into unlawful channels, in 1970 the New York Legislature created a special commission to evaluate  [***69]  the State's drugcontrol laws. 4Link to the text of the note The commission found the existing laws deficient  [*592]  in several respects. There was no effective way to prevent the use of stolen or revised prescriptions, to prevent unscrupulous pharmacists from repeatedly refilling prescriptions, to prevent users from obtaining prescriptions from more than one doctor, [****7]  or to prevent doctors from overprescribing, either by authorizing an excessive amount in one prescription or by giving one patient multiple prescriptions. 5Link to the text of the note In drafting new legislation to correct such defects, the commission consulted with enforcement officials in California and Illinois where central  [**873]  reporting systems were being used effectively. 6Link to the text of the note

 [****8]  The new New York statute classified potentially harmful drugs in five schedules. 7Link to the text of the note Drugs, such as heroin, which are highly abused and have no recognized medical use, are in Schedule I; they cannot be prescribed. Schedules II through V include drugs which have a progressively lower potential for abuse but also have a recognized medical use. Our  [*593]  concern is limited to Schedule II, which includes the most dangerous of the legitimate drugs. 8Link to the text of the note

With an exception for emergencies, the Act requires [****9]  that all prescriptions for Schedule II drugs be prepared by the physician in triplicate on an official form. 9Link to the text of the note The completed form identifies the prescribing physician; the dispensing pharmacy; the drug and dosage; and the name, address, and age of the patient. One copy of the form is retained by the physician, the second by the pharmacist, and the third is forwarded to the New York State Department of Health in Albany. A prescription made on an official form may not  [***70]  exceed a 30-day supply, and may not be refilled. 10Link to the text of the note

 [****10]  The District Court found that about 100,000 Schedule II prescription forms are delivered to a receiving room at the Department of Health in Albany each month. They are sorted, coded, and logged and then taken to another room where the data on the forms is recorded on magnetic tapes for processing by a computer. Thereafter, the forms are returned to the receiving room to be retained in a vault for a five-year period and then destroyed as required by the statute. 11Link to the text of the note  [*594]  The receiving room is surrounded by a locked wire fence and protected by an alarm system. The computer tapes containing the prescription data are kept in a locked cabinet. When the tapes are used, the computer is run "off-line," which means that no terminal outside of the computer room can read or record any information. Public disclosure of the identity of patients is expressly prohibited by the statute and by a Department of Health regulation. 12Link to the text of the note [****12]  Willful violation  [*595]  of these prohibitions is a  [**874]  crime punishable by up to one year in prison and a $ 2,000 fine. 13Link to the text of the note At the time of trial there were 17 Department of Health employees with access to the files; in addition, there were [****11]  24 investigators with authority to investigate cases of overdispensing which might be identified  [***71]  by the computer. Twenty months after the effective date of the Act, the computerized data had only been used in two investigations involving alleged overuse by specific patients.

A few days before the Act became effective, this litigation was commenced by a group of patients regularly receiving prescriptions for Schedule II drugs, by doctors who prescribe such drugs, and by two associations of physicians. 14Link to the text of the note After various preliminary proceedings, 15Link to the text of the note [****13]  a three-judge District Court conducted a one-day trial. Appellees offered evidence tending to prove that persons in need of treatment with Schedule II drugs will from time to time decline such treatment because of their fear that the missuse of the computerized data will cause them to be stigmatized as "drug addicts." 16Link to the text of the note

 [****14]  [*596]  The District Court held that "the doctor-patient relationship is one of the  [**875]  zones of privacy accorded constitutional protection" and that the patient-identification provisions of the Act invaded this zone with "a needlessly broad sweep," and enjoined enforcement of the provisions of the Act which deal with the reporting of patients' names and addresses. 17Link to the text of the note

I 

LEdHN[1B] [1B]The District Court found that the State had been unable to demonstrate the necessity for the patient-identification requirement on the basis of its experience during the first 20 months of administration of the new statute. There was a time when that alone would have provided a basis for invalidating the statute. Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, involved legislation making it a crime for a baker to permit his employees to work more than 60 hours in a week. In an [****15]  opinion no longer regarded as authoritative, the Court held the statute unconstitutional as "an unreasonable, unnecessary and arbitrary interference with the right of the individual to his personal liberty…." Id., at 56.



 [*597]  LEdHN[4] [4]LEdHN[5A] [5A]The holding in Lochner has  [***72]  been implicitly rejected many times. 18Link to the text of the note [****16] HN2 State legislation which has some effect on individual liberty or privacy may not be held unconstitutional simply because a court finds it unnecessary, in whole or in part. 19Link to the text of the note For we have frequently recognized that individual States have broad latitude in experimenting with possible solutions to problems of vital local concern. 20Link to the text of the note

LEdHN[5B] [5B]

 [****17]  LEdHN[6A] [6A]The New York statute challenged in this case represents a considered attempt to deal with such a problem. It is manifestly the product of an orderly and rational legislative decision. It was recommended by a specially appointed commission which held extensive hearings on the proposed legislation, and drew on experience with similar programs in other States. There surely was nothing unreasonable in the assumption that the patient-identification requirement might  [*598]  aid in the enforcement of laws designed to minimize the misuse of dangerous drugs. For the requirement could reasonably be expected to have a deterrent effect on potential violators 21Link to the text of the note [****19]  as  [**876]  well as to aid in the detection or investigation of specific instances of apparent abuse. At the very least, it would seem clear that the State's vital interest in controlling the distribution of dangerous drugs would support a decision to experiment with new techniques for control. 22Link to the text of the note For if an experiment fails - if in this case experience teaches that the patient-identification requirement results in  [***73]  the foolish expenditure [****18]  of funds to acquire a mountain of useless information - the legislative process remains available to terminate the unwise experiment. It follows that the legislature's enactment of the patient-identification requirement was a reasonable exercise of New York's broad police powers. The District Court's finding that the necessity for the requirement had not been proved is not, therefore, a sufficient reason for holding the statutory requirement unconstitutional.

LEdHN[6B] [6B]

II 

LEdHN[2B] [2B]LEdHN[7A] [7A]Appellees contend that the statute invades a constitutionally protected "zone of privacy." 23Link to the text of the note [****21]  The HN3 cases sometimes  [*599]  characterized as protecting "privacy" have in fact involved at least two different kinds of interests. 24Link to the text of the note One is the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters, 25Link to the text of the note [****22]  and another is the interest in independence in making certain  [*600]  kinds of important decisions. 26Link to the text of the note Appellees argue that both of these  [**877]  interests are impaired by this  [***74]  statute. The mere existence in readily available form of the information about patients' use of Schedule II drugs creates a genuine concern [****20]  that the information will become publicly known and that it will adversely affect their reputations. This concern makes some patients reluctant to use, and some doctors reluctant to prescribe, such drugs even when their use is medically indicated. It follows, they argue, that the making of decisions about matters vital to the care of their health is inevitably affected by the statute. Thus, the statute threatens to impair both their interest in the nondisclosure of private information and also their interest in making important decisions independently.

LEdHN[7B] [7B]

We are persuaded, however, that the New York program does not, on its face, pose a sufficiently grievous threat to either interest to establish a constitutional violation.

Public disclosure of patient information can come about in three ways. Health Department employees may violate the statute by failing, either deliberately or negligently, to maintain proper security.  [****23]  A patient or a doctor may be accused of a violation and the stored data may be offered in evidence in a judicial proceeding. Or, thirdly, a doctor, a pharmacist, or the patient may voluntarily reveal information on a prescription form.

LEdHN[8A] [8A]The third possibility existed under the prior law and is entirely unrelated to the existence of the computerized  [*601]  data bank. Neither of the other two possibilities provides a proper ground for attacking the statute as invalid on its face. There is no support in the record, or in the experience of the two States that New York has emulated, for an assumption that the security provisions of the statute will be administered improperly. 27Link to the text of the note [****24]  And the remote possibility that judicial supervision of the  [***75]  evidentiary use of particular items of stored information will provide inadequate protection  [*602]  against unwarranted disclosures is surely not a sufficient reason for invalidating the entire patient-identification program. 28Link to the text of the note

Even  [**878]  without public disclosure, it is, of course, true that private information must be disclosed to the authorized employees of the New York Department of Health. Such disclosures, however, are not significantly different from those that were required under the prior law. Nor are they meaningfully distinguishable from a host of other unpleasant invasions of privacy that are associated with many facets of health care. Unquestionably, some individuals' concern for their own privacy may lead them to avoid or to postpone needed medical attention. Nevertheless, disclosures of private medical information to doctors, to hospital personnel, to insurance companies,  [****25]  and to public health agencies are often an essential part of modern medical practice even when the disclosure may reflect unfavorably on the character of the patient. 29Link to the text of the note Requiring such disclosures to representatives of the State having responsibility for the health of the community, does not automatically amount to an impermissible invasion of privacy.

Appellees also argue, however, that even if unwarranted disclosures do not actually occur, the knowledge that the information is readily available in a computerized file creates a genuine concern that causes [****26]  some persons to decline needed  [*603]  medication. The record supports the conclusion that some use of Schedule II drugs has been discouraged by that concern; it also is clear, however, that about 100,000 prescriptions for such drugs were being filled each month prior to the entry of the District Court's injunction. Clearly, therefore, the statute did not deprive the public of access to the drugs. 

LEdHN[9A] [9A]Nor can it be said that any individual has been deprived of the right to decide independently, with the advice of his physician, to acquire and to use needed medication. Although the State no doubt could prohibit entirely the use of particular Schedule II drugs, 30Link to the text of the note it has not done so. This case is therefore unlike those in which the Court held that a total prohibition of certain conduct was an impermissible deprivation of  [***76]  liberty. Nor does the State require access to these drugs to be conditioned on the consent of any state official or other third party. 31Link to the text of the note Within dosage limits which appellees do not challenge, the decision to prescribe, or to use, is left entirely to the physician and [****27]  the patient. 

LEdHN[9B] [9B]

We hold that HN4 neither the immediate nor the threatened [****28]  impact of the patient-identification requirements in the New York State Controlled Substances Act of 1972 on either the reputation or the independence of patients for whom Schedule II drugs are medically indicated is sufficient to constitute an  [*604]  invasion of any right or liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. 32Link to the text of the note

 [****29]  III

 [**879]  LEdHN[3B] [3B]The appellee doctors argue separately that the statute impairs their right to practice medicine free of unwarranted state interference. If the doctors' claim has any reference to the impact of the 1972 statute on their own procedures, it is clearly frivolous. For even the prior statute required the doctor to prepare a written prescription identifying the name and address of the patient and the dosage of the prescribed drug. To the extent that their claim has reference to the possibility that the patients' concern about disclosure may induce them to refuse needed medication, the doctors' claim is derivative from, and therefore no stronger than, the patients'. 33Link to the text of the note Our rejection of  [***77]  their claim therefore disposes of the doctors' as well.

 [****30]  [*605]  IV

A final word about issues we have not decided. We are not unaware of the threat to privacy implicit in the accumulation of vast amounts of personal information in computerized data banks or other massive government files. 34Link to the text of the note The collection of taxes, the distribution of welfare and social security benefits, the supervision of public health, the direction of our Armed Forces, and the enforcement of the criminal laws all require the orderly preservation of great quantities of information, much of which is personal in character and potentially embarrassing or harmful if disclosed. The right to collect and use such data for public purposes is typically accompanied by a concomitant statutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures. Recognizing that in some circumstances that duty arguably has its roots in the Constitution, nevertheless New York's statutory scheme, and its implementing administrative procedures, evidence a proper concern with, and protection of, the individual's interest in privacy. We therefore need not, and do not, decide any question which might be presented by the unwarranted disclosure  [*606]  of accumulated private data - whether [****31]  intentional or unintentional - or by a system that did not contain comparable security provisions. We simply hold that this record does not establish an  [**880]  invasion of any right or liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

Two parents testified that they were concerned that their children would be stigmatized by the State's central filing system. One child had been taken off his Schedule II medication because of this concern. Three adult patients testified that they feared disclosure of their names would result from central filing of patient identifications. One of them now obtains his drugs in another State. The other two continue to receive Schedule II prescriptions in New York, but continue to fear disclosure and stigmatization. Four physicians testified that the prescription system entrenches on patients' privacy, and that each had observed a reaction of shock, fear, and concern on the part of their patients whom they had informed of the plan. One doctor refuses to prescribe Schedule II drugs for his patients. On the other hand, over 100,000 patients per month have been receiving Schedule II drug prescriptions without their objections, if any, to central filing having come to the attention of the District Court. The record shows that the provisions of the Act were brought to the attention of the section on psychiatry of the New York State Medical Society (App. 166a), but that body apparently declined to support this suit.

Mr. Justice Brandeis' classic statement of the proposition merits reiteration:

"To stay experimentation in things social and economic is a grave responsibility. Denial of the right to experiment may be fraught with serious consequences to the Nation. It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country. This Court has the power to prevent an experiment. We may strike down the statute which embodies it on the ground that, in our opinion, the measure is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. We have power to do this, because the due process clause has been held by the Court applicable to matters of substantive law as well as to matters of procedure. But in the exercise of this high power, we must be ever on our guard, lest we erect our prejudices into legal principles. If we would guide by the light of reason, we must let our minds be bold."

As the basis for the constitutional claim they rely on the shadows cast by a variety of provisions in the Bill of Rights. Language in prior opinions of the Court or its individual Justices provides support for the view that some personal rights "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty" (see Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325, quoted in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S., at 152), are so "fundamental" that an undefined penumbra may provide them with an independent source of constitutional protection. In Roe v. Wade, however, after carefully reviewing those cases, the Court expressed the opinion that the "right of privacy" is founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty, id., at 152-153.

"This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."

Professor Kurland has written:

"The concept of a constitutional right of privacy still remains largely undefined. There are at least three facets that have been partially revealed, but their form and shape remain to be fully ascertained. The first is the right of the individual to be free in his private affairs from governmental surveillance and intrusion. The second is the right of an individual not to have his private affairs made public by the government. The third is the right of an individual to be free in action, thought, experience, and belief from governmental compulsion." The private I, the University of Chicago Magazine 7, 8 (autumn 1976). The first of the facets which he describes is directly protected by the Fourth Amendment; the second and third correspond to the two kinds of interests referred to in the text.

Just last Term in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, we rejected a contention that the reporting requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 violated the First Amendment rights of those who contribute to minority parties:

"But no appellant in this case has tendered record evidence…. Instead, appellants primarily rely on 'the clearly articulated fears of individuals, well experienced in the political process.'… At best they offer the testimony of several minor-party officials that one or two persons refused to make contributions because of the possibility of disclosure. On this record, the substantial public interest in disclosure identified by the legislative history of this Act outweighs the harm generally alleged." 424 U.S., at 71-72 (footnote omitted).

Here, too, appellees urge on us "clearly articulated fears" about the pernicious effects of disclosure. But this requires us to assume even more than that we refused to do in Buckley. There the disclosures were to be made in accordance with the statutory scheme. Appellees' disclosures could only be made if the statutory scheme were violated as described, supra, at 594-595.

The fears of parents on behalf of their pre-adolescent children who are receiving amphetamines in the treatment of hyperkinesia are doubly premature. Not only must the Act's nondisclosure provisions be violated in order to stigmatize the children as they enter adult life, but the provisions requiring destruction of all prescription records after five years would have to be ignored, see n. 11, supra, and accompanying text.

The physician-patient evidentiary privilege is unknown to the common law. In States where it exists by legislative enactment, it is subject to many exceptions and to waiver for many reasons. C. McCormick, Evidence §§ 98, 101-104 (2d ed. 1972); 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2380, nn. 3, 5, 6, §§ 2388-2391 (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961).

Familiar examples are statutory reporting requirements relating to venereal disease, child abuse, injuries caused by deadly weapons, and certifications of fetal death. Last Term we upheld the recordkeeping requirements of the Missouri abortion laws against a challenge based on the protected interest in making the abortion decision free of governmental intrusion, Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 79-81.

It is, of course, well settled that the State has broad police powers in regulating the administration of drugs by the health professions. Robinson v. California, 370 U.S., at 664-665; Minnesota ex rel. Whipple v. Martinson, 256 U.S., at 45; Barsky v. Board of Regents, 347 U.S. 442, 449.

In Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, for instances, the constitutionally defective statute required the written concurrence of two state-licensed physicians, other than the patient's personal physician, before an abortion could be performed, and the advance approval of a committee of not less than three members of the hospital staff where the procedure was to be performed, regardless of whether the committee members had a physician-patient relationship with the woman concerned.

The Roe appellees also claim that a constitutional privacy right emanates from the Fourth Amendment, citing language in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 9, at a point where it quotes from Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347. But those cases involve affirmative, unannounced, narrowly focused intrusions into individual privacy during the course of criminal investigations. We have never carried the Fourth Amendment's interest in privacy as far as the Roe appellees would have us. We decline to do so now.

Likewise the Patient appellees derive a right to individual anonymity from our freedom of association cases such as Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 522-523, and NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 462. But those cases protect "freedom of association for the purpose of advancing ideas and airing grievances," Bates v. Little Rock, supra, at 523, not anonymity in the course of medical treatment. Also, in those cases there was an uncontroverted showing of past harm through disclosure, NAACP v. Alabama, supra, at 462, an element which is absent here.

The doctors rely on two references to a physician's right to administer medical care in the opinion in Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S., at 197-198, and 199. Nothing in that case suggests that a doctor's right to administer medical care has any greater strength than his patient's right to receive such care. The constitutional right vindicated in Doe was the right of a pregnant woman to decide whether or not to bear a child without unwarranted state interference. The statutory restrictions on the abortion procedures were invalid because they encumbered the woman's exercise of that constitutionally protected right by placing obstacles in the path of the doctor upon whom she was entitled to rely for advice in connection with her decision. If those obstacles had not impacted upon the woman's freedom to make a constitutionally protected decision, if they had merely made the physician's work more laborious or less independent without any impact on the patient, they would not have violated the Constitution.
