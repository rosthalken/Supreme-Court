JETT v. DALLAS INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT

No. 87-2084

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

491 U.S. 701

March 28, 1989, Argued 
June 22, 1989, Decided

JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
My agreement with Justice Brennan's dissent is buttressed by the views I expressed in Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U.S. 1, 22 (1981) (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), and in Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 834 (1985) (dissenting opinion).
