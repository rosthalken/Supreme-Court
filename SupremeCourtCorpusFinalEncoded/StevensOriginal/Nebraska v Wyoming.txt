STATE OF NEBRASKA, PLAINTIFF V. STATES OF WYOMING AND COLORADO

No. 108 ORIG.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

504 U.S. 982

June 15, 1992, Decided 

JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
Because I do not believe that the Court has authority to assess costs against nonparties, I respectfully dissent from the order to the extent it provides for an assessment against amici curiae. 1  [*983]  I do not think that it is proper for the Court to justify its exercise of this authority on the basis of the amici's failure to object, especially when the assessment is for an interim payment to the Special Master in the course of an ongoing proceeding. 2
