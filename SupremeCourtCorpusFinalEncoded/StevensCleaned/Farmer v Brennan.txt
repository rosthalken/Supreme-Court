While I continue to believe that a state official may inflict cruel and unusual punishment without any improper subjective motivation, see Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 116-117, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251, 97 S. Ct. 285 (1976) (dissenting opinion); Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 306-307, 115 L. Ed. 2d 271, 111 S. Ct. 2321 (1991) (White, J., concurring     in judgment), I join JUSTICE SOUTER's thoughtful opinion because it is faithful to our precedents.
