*68 Justice THOMAS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I join Parts I and III of the Court’s opinion and respectfully dissent from Part **2148 II, which holds that § 144 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, 7 U.S.C. § 7254, “does not clearly express an intent to insulate California’s pricing and pooling laws from a Commerce Clause challenge.” Ante, at 2147. Although I agree that the Court of Appeals erred in its statutory analysis, I nevertheless would affirm its judgment on this claim because “[t]he negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the text of the Constitution, makes little sense, and has proved virtually unworkable in application,” Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U.S. 564, 610, 117 S.Ct. 1590, 137 L.Ed.2d 852 (1997) (THOMAS, J., dissenting), and, consequently, cannot serve as a basis for striking down a state statute.
