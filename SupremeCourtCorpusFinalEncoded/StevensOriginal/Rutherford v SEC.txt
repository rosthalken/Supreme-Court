RUTHERFORD, RICHARD, Appellant V. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

No. 87-6958

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

487 U.S. 1216

June 27, 1988

Justice Brennan, Justice Marshall,  [*904]  Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens, dissenting: For the reasons expressed in Brown v. Herald Co., Inc., 464 U.S. 928 (1983), we would dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction and, treating the papers whereon the appeal was taken as a petition for writ of certiorari, deny the petition for a writ of certiorari without reaching the merits of the motion to proceed in forma pauperis.
