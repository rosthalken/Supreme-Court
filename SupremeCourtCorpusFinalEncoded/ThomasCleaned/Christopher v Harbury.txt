
In Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996), after a review of the constitutional text, this Court’s precedent, and tradition, I could find no basis “for the conclusion that the constitutional right of access imposes affirmative obligations on the States to finance and support prisoner litigation.” Id., at 384–385, 116 S.Ct. 2174 (concurring opinion). Likewise, I find no basis in the Constitution for a “right of access to courts” that effectively imposes an affirmative duty on Government officials either to disclose matters concerning national security or to provide information in response **2191 to informal requests. Notwithstanding the Court of Appeals’ attempt to characterize *423 the right of access differently, see Harbury v. Deutch, 233 F.3d 596, 611 (C.A.D.C.2000) (characterizing the right as “when public officials affirmatively mislead citizens in order to prevent them from filing suit”), I would decide this case solely on the ground that no such right is implicated here. For that reason, I concur in the judgment.
