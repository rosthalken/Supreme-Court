
On January 31, 1991, I voted to deny the government's application to     stay the District Court's injunctions in this case because, in my view, the petitioners deserved the additional twenty-four hours, they had requested for the purpose of taking depositions and filing a response. The petitioners have since briefed the merits of their petition for certiorari, and I now conclude that under the standards this Court has traditionally employed, cf. S. Ct. Rule 10.1, the petition should be denied.
The affidavits filed throughout this litigation have sought to describe the conditions in     Haiti and the treatment the returnees have received there. I am deeply concerned about these allegations. However, this matter must be addressed by the political branches, for our role is limited to questions of law. Because none of the legal issues presented in this petition provides a basis for review, I join the Court's denial of certiorari.
