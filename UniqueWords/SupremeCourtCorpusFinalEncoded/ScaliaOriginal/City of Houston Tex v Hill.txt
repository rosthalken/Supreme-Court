Supreme Court of the United States
CITY OF HOUSTON, TEXAS, Appellant,
v.
Raymond Wayne HILL.
No. 86–243.
|
Argued March 23, 1987.
|
Decided June 15, 1987.

Justice SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.
For the reasons stated by Justice POWELL in Part II of his opinion, I agree that abstention would not be appropriate in this case. Because I do not believe that the Houston ordinance is reasonably susceptible of a limiting construction that would avoid the constitutional question posed in this case, I agree with the Court that certification would also be inappropriate. On the merits, I agree with the views expressed by *473 Justice POWELL in Part III **2516 of his opinion. I therefore concur in the judgment and joins Parts II and III of Justice POWELL’s opinion.
