JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.

In my opinion all executions in Georgia Should be postponed until the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit renders its en banc decision in Spencer v.  [**566]  Zant, 715 F. 2d 1562 (1983). See Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 15-17 (1963). The "ends of justice would not be served" by the execution of this petitioner while the Court of Appeals is deciding the merits of the claim he asserts. I therefore would grant the stay application.
