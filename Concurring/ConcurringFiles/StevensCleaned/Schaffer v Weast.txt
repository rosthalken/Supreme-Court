It is common ground that no single principle or rule solves all cases by setting forth a general test for ascertaining the incidence of proof burdens when both a statute and its legislative history are silent on the question. See Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation v. EPA, 540 U.S. 461, 494, n. 17,     124 S. Ct. 983, 157 L. Ed. 2d 967 (2004); see also ante, at 57, 163 L. Ed. 2d, at 396; post, at 1-2, 163 L. Ed. 2d, at 400-401 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Accordingly, I do not understand the majority to disagree with the proposition that a court, taking into account "'policy considerations, convenience, and fairness,'" post, at 63, 163 L. Ed. 2d, at 400 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting), could conclude that the purpose of a statute is best effectuated by placing the burden of persuasion on the defendant. Moreover, I agree with much of what Justice Ginsburg has written about the special aspects of this statute. I have, however, decided to join the Court's disposition of this case, not only for the reasons set forth in Justice O'Connor's opinion, but also because I believe that we should presume that public school officials     are properly performing their difficult responsibilities under this important statute.
