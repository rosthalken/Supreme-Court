CORNELL JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

No. 99-5153

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

529 U.S. 694

February 22, 2000, Argued 
May 15, 2000, Decided

JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court's textual analysis of 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3) (1988 ed., Supp. V), and think that analysis sufficient to resolve this case. I agree with JUSTICE KENNEDY that the Court's discussions of § 3583(a), ante, at 13-14, and § 3583(e)(2), ante, at 18, are unnecessary to the result. I would not rely, as the Court (ante, at 14-15) and JUSTICE KENNEDY (ante, at 2) do, on any apparent congressional purpose supporting the Court's reading of § 3583(e)(3). With these observations, I concur in the judgment.
