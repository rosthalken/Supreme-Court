497 U.S. 376
GEORGIA v. SOUTH CAROLINA
Supreme Court of the United States
January 8, 1990, Argued ; June 25, 1990, Decided
No. 74, Orig.

JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY joins, dissenting in part.

I would sustain South Carolina's exceptions with respect to southeastern Denwill and Horseshoe Shoal, and I accordingly dissent from Part VII of the Court's opinion. The Court does not purport to alter settled principles of law regarding accretion and avulsion but, applying those principles to the specifics of this record and acknowledging the question to be close, approves the determination of the Master. In my view, the facts do not support the Court's holding.
