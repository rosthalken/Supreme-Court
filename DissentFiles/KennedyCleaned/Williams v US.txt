
I adhere to the view that we should not vacate a court of appeals' judgment favoring the Government when the Solicitor General disagrees with the reasoning of the court of appeals but defends its result. See Diaz-Albertini v. United States, 498 U.S.    ,     (1991) (REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting); Alvarado v. United States, 497 U.S.    ,     -     (1990) (REHNQUIST,     C. J., dissenting). That is the position the Government again takes in the case before us, and I dissent from the order granting certiorari, vacating the judgment, and remanding the case.
