518 U.S. 267
UNITED STATES, PETITIONER 95-345 v. GUY JEROME URSERY
Supreme Court of the United States
April 17, 1996, Argued ; June 24, 1996 *Link to the text of the note, Decided
No. 95-345

JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, concurring in the judgment.

In my view, the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits successive prosecution, not successive punishment. See Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U.S. 767, 798, 114 S. Ct. 1937, 128 L. Ed. 2d 767 (1994) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Civil forfeiture proceedings of the sort at issue here are not criminal prosecutions, even under the standard of Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 164, 9 L. Ed. 2d 644, 83 S. Ct. 554 (1963), and United States v. Ward, 448 U.S. 242, 248-251, 65 L. Ed. 2d 742, 100 S. Ct. 2636 (1980).
