THOMAS KNIGHT, AKA ASKARI ABDULLAH MUHAMMAD v. FLORIDA; CAREY DEAN MOORE v. NEBRASKA

Nos. 98-9741 and 99-5291

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

528 U.S. 990

November 8, 1999, Decided

Opinion of JUSTICE STEVENS, respecting the denial of the petitions for writ of certiorari.
It seems appropriate to emphasize that the denial of these petitions for certiorari does not constitute a ruling on the merits. See, e.g., Barber v. Tennessee, 513 U.S. 1184, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1129, 115 S. Ct. 1177 (1995).
