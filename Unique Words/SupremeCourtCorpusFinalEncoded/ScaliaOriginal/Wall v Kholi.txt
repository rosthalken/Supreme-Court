Supreme Court of the United States
Ashbel T. WALL, II, Director, Rhode Island Department of Corrections, Petitioner,
v.
Khalil KHOLI.
No. 09–868.
|
Argued Nov. 29, 2010.
|
Decided March 7, 2011.
Justice SCALIA, concurring in part.

*561 The Court holds that the term “collateral review” in 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) means review that is not direct, ante, at 1284, and that a motion under Rhode Island’s Rule 35 seeks collateral review, ante, at 1286. Because I agree with those conclusions, I cannot join footnote 3 of the Court’s opinion, ante, at 1286, n. 3, which declines to decide whether a Rule 35 motion seeks direct review.
