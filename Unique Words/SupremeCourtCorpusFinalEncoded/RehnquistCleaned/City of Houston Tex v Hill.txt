
I join Parts I and II of Justice POWELL’S opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part. I do not *482 agree, however, that the Houston ordinance, in the absence of an authoritative construction by the Texas courts, is unconstitutional. See Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130, 136, 94 S.Ct. 970, 973, 39 L.Ed.2d 214 (1974) (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting). I therefore dissent from the Court’s affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
