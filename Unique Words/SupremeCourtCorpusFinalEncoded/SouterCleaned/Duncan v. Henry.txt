I concur in the judgment because respondent's "miscarriage of justice" claim in state court was reasonably understood     to raise a state-law issue of prejudice, not a federal issue of due process. Consequently, no federal claim was "fairly presented to the state courts" within the meaning of     Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275, 30 L. Ed. 2d 438, 92 S. Ct. 509 (1971).
