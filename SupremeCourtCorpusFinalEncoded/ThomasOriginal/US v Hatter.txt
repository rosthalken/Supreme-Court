Supreme Court of the United States
UNITED STATES, Petitioner,
v.
Terry J. HATTER, Jr., Judge, United States District Court for the Central District of California, et al.
No. 99-1978.
|
Argued Feb. 20, 2001.
|
Decided May 21, 2001.
 
Justice THOMAS, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.

I believe this Court was correct in Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245, 40 S.Ct. 550, 64 L.Ed. 887 (1920), when it held that any tax that reduces a judge’s *587 net compensation violates Article III of the Constitution. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in its entirety.
