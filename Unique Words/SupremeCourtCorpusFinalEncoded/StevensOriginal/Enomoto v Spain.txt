424 U.S. 951 

MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.

Since I am not persuaded that the applicants have demonstrated a sufficient threat of irreparable injury to justify the exercise of this Court's power to issue a stay, I would deny the application.

The Court issued this order in amended form on March 11, 1976, having substituted the bracketed phrase for "further order of the Court."
