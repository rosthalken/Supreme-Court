
Respondent Alvin Dixon possessed cocaine with intent to distribute it. For that he was held in contempt of court for violating a condition of his bail release. He was later criminally charged for the same conduct with possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Respondent Michael Foster assaulted and threatened his estranged wife. For that he was held in contempt of court for violating a civil protection order entered in a domestic relations proceeding. He was later criminally charged for the same conduct with assault, threatening to injure another, and assault with intent to kill.
 
The Court today concludes that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits the subsequent prosecutions of Foster for assault and Dixon for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, but does not prohibit the subsequent prosecutions of Foster for threatening to injure another or for assault with intent to kill. After finding that at least some of the charges here are not prohibited by the “same-elements” test set out in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), the Court goes on to consider whether there is a double jeopardy bar under the “same-conduct” test set out in Grady v. Corbin, 495 U.S. 508, 510, 110 S.Ct. 2084, 2087, 109 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990), and determines that there is. However, because the same-conduct test is inconsistent with the text and history of the Double Jeopardy Clause, was a departure from our earlier precedents, and has proven difficult to apply, the Court concludes that Grady must be overruled. I do not join Part III of Justice SCALIA’s opinion because I think that none of the criminal prosecutions in this case were barred under Blockburger. I must then confront the expanded version of double jeopardy embodied in Grady. For the reasons set forth in the dissent in Grady, supra, at 526, 110 S.Ct., at 2096 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), and in Part IV of the Court’s opinion, I, too, think that Grady must be overruled. I *714 therefore join Parts I, II, and IV of the Court’s opinion, and write separately to express my disagreement with Justice SCALIA’s application of Blockburger in Part III.
 
In my view, Blockburger’s same-elements test requires us to focus, not on the terms of the particular court orders involved, but on the elements of contempt of court in the ordinary sense. Relying on Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U.S. 682, 97 S.Ct. 2912, 53 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1977), a three-paragraph per curiam in an unargued case, Justice SCALIA concludes otherwise today, and thus incorrectly finds in Part III–A of his opinion that the subsequent prosecutions of Dixon for drug distribution and of Foster for assault violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. In so doing, Justice SCALIA rejects the traditional view—shared by every federal court of appeals and state supreme court that addressed the issue prior to Grady—that, as a general matter, double jeopardy does not bar a subsequent prosecution based on conduct for which a defendant has been held in criminal contempt. I cannot subscribe to a reading of Harris that upsets this previously well-settled principle of law. Because the generic crime of contempt of court has different elements than the substantive criminal charges in this case, I believe that they are separate offenses under Blockburger. I would therefore limit Harris to the context in which it arose: where the crimes in question are analogous to greater and lesser included offenses. The crimes at issue here bear no such resemblance.
 
Justice SCALIA dismisses out-of-hand, see ante, at 2857, the Government’s reliance on several statements from our prior decisions. See In re Debs, 158 U.S. 564, 594, 599–600, 15 S.Ct. 900, 910, 912, 39 L.Ed. 1092 (1895); In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 672, 17 S.Ct. 677, 681, 41 L.Ed. 1154 (1897); Jurney v. MacCracken, 294 U.S. 125, 151, 55 S.Ct. 375, 379, 79 L.Ed. 802 (1935). Those statements **2866 are dicta, to be sure, and thus not binding on us as stare decisis. Yet they are still significant in that they reflect the unchallenged contemporaneous view among all courts that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit separate prosecutions for contempt and a substantive offense based *715 on the same conduct.1 This view, which dates back to the English common law, see F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading and Practice § 444, p. 300 (8th ed. 1880), has prevailed to the present day. See generally 21 Am.Jur.2d, Criminal Law § 250, p. 446 (1981). In fact, every federal court of appeals and state court of last resort to consider the issue before Grady agreed that there is no double jeopardy bar to successive prosecutions for criminal contempt and substantive criminal offenses based on the same conduct. See, e.g., Hansen v. United States, 1 F.2d 316, 317 (CA7 1924); Orban v. United States, 18 F.2d 374, 375 (CA6 1927); State v. Sammons, 656 S.W.2d 862, 868–869 (Tenn.Crim.App.1982); Commonwealth v. Allen, 506 Pa. 500, 511–516, 486 A.2d 363, 368–371 (1984), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 842, 106 S.Ct. 128, 88 L.Ed.2d 105 (1985); People v. Totten, 118 Ill.2d 124, 134–139, 113 Ill.Dec. 47, 51–53, 514 N.E.2d 959, 963–965 (1987).2 It is somewhat ironic, I think, that Justice SCALIA today adopts a view of double jeopardy that did not come to the fore until after Grady, a decision which he (for the Court) goes on to emphatically reject as “lack[ing] constitutional roots.” Ante, at 2860.
 
At the heart of this pre-Grady consensus lay the common belief that there was no double jeopardy bar under Blockburger. There, we stated that two offenses are different for *716 purposes of double jeopardy if “each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.” 284 U.S., at 304, 52 S.Ct., at 182 (emphasis added). Applying this test to the offenses at bar, it is clear that the elements of the governing contempt provision are entirely different from the elements of the substantive crimes. Contempt of court comprises two elements: (i) a court order made known to the defendant, followed by (ii) willful violation of that order. In re Gorfkle, 444 A.2d 934, 939 (D.C.1982); In re Thompson, 454 A.2d 1324, 1326 (D.C.1982). Neither of those elements is necessarily satisfied by proof that a defendant has committed the substantive offenses of assault or drug distribution. Likewise, no element of either of those substantive offenses is necessarily satisfied by proof that a defendant has been found guilty of contempt of court.
 
Justice SCALIA grounds his departure from Blockburger’s customary focus on the statutory elements of the crimes charged on Harris v. Oklahoma, supra, an improbable font of authority. See ante, at 2856–2857. A summary reversal, like Harris, “does not enjoy the full precedential value of a case argued on the merits.” Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U.S. 1, 12, n. 4, 111 S.Ct. 2105, 2113, n. 4, 115 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991); accord, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 671, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1359, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). Today’s decision shows the pitfalls inherent in reading too much into a “terse per curiam.” Ante, at 2857. Justice SCALIA’s discussion of Harris is nearly as long as Harris itself and consists largely of a quote, not from Harris, but from a subsequent opinion analyzing Harris. Justice SCALIA then concludes **2867 that Harris somehow requires us to look to the facts that must be proved under the particular court orders in question (rather than under the general law of criminal contempt) in determining whether contempt and the related substantive offenses are the same for double jeopardy purposes. This interpretation of Harris is both unprecedented and mistaken.
 
Our double jeopardy cases applying Blockburger have focused on the statutory elements of the offenses charged, not *717 on the facts that must be proved under the particular indictment at issue—an indictment being the closest analogue to the court orders in this case. See, e.g., Grady, 495 U.S., at 528, 110 S.Ct., at 2097 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“Th[e] test focuses on the statutory elements of the two crimes with which a defendant has been charged, not on the proof that is offered or relied upon to secure a conviction”); Albernaz v. United States, 450 U.S. 333, 338, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 1142, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981) (“ ‘[T]he Court’s application of the test focuses on the statutory elements of the offense’ ” (quoting Iannelli v. United States, 420 U.S. 770, 785, n. 17, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 1293–1294, n. 17, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975))); United States v. Woodward, 469 U.S. 105, 108, 105 S.Ct. 611, 612, 83 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (per curiam) (looking to the statutory elements of the offense in applying Blockburger ). By focusing on the facts needed to show a violation of the specific court orders involved in this case, and not on the generic elements of the crime of contempt of court, Justice SCALIA’s double jeopardy analysis bears a striking resemblance to that found in Grady—not what one would expect in an opinion that overrules Grady.
 
Close inspection of the crimes at issue in Harris reveals, moreover, that our decision in that case was not a departure from Blockburger’s focus on the statutory elements of the offenses charged. In Harris, we held that a conviction for felony murder based on a killing in the course of an armed robbery foreclosed a subsequent prosecution for robbery with a firearm. Though the felony-murder statute in Harris did not require proof of armed robbery, it did include as an element proof that the defendant was engaged in the commission of some felony. Harris v. State, 555 P.2d 76, 80 (Okla.Crim.App.1976). We construed this generic reference to some felony as incorporating the statutory elements of the various felonies upon which a felony-murder conviction could rest. Cf. Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 694, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1439, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980). The criminal contempt provision involved here, by contrast, contains no such generic reference which by definition incorporates the statutory elements of assault or drug distribution.
 
*718 Unless we are to accept the extraordinary view that the three-paragraph per curiam in Harris was intended to overrule sub silentio our previous decisions that looked to the statutory elements of the offenses charged in applying Blockburger, we are bound to conclude, as does Justice SCALIA, see ante, at 2857, that the ratio decidendi of our Harris decision was that the two crimes there were akin to greater and lesser included offenses. The crimes at issue here, however, cannot be viewed as greater and lesser included offenses, either intuitively or logically. A crime such as possession with intent to distribute cocaine is a serious felony that cannot easily be conceived of as a lesser included offense of criminal contempt, a relatively petty offense as applied to the conduct in this case. See D.C.Code Ann. § 33–541(a)(2)(A) (Supp.1992) (the maximum sentence for possession with intent to distribute cocaine is 15 years in prison). Indeed, to say that criminal contempt is an aggravated form of that offense defies common sense. Even courts that have found a double jeopardy bar in cases resembling this one have appreciated how counterintuitive that notion is. E.g., United States v. Haggerty, 528 F.Supp. 1286, 1297 (Colo.1981).
 
But there is a more fundamental reason why the offenses in this case are not analogous **2868 to greater and lesser included offenses. A lesser included offense is defined as one that is “necessarily included” within the statutory elements of another offense. See Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 31(c); Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S. 705, 716–717, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 1450, 103 L.Ed.2d 734 (1989). Taking the facts of Harris as an example, a defendant who commits armed robbery necessarily has satisfied one of the statutory elements of felony murder. The same cannot be said, of course, about this case: A defendant who is guilty of possession with intent to distribute cocaine or of assault has not necessarily satisfied any statutory element of criminal contempt. Nor, for that matter, can it be said that a defendant who is held in criminal contempt has necessarily satisfied any *719 element of those substantive crimes. In short, the offenses for which Dixon and Foster were prosecuted in this case cannot be analogized to greater and lesser included offenses; hence, they are separate and distinct for double jeopardy purposes.3
 
The following analogy, raised by the Government at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 8–9, helps illustrate the absurd results that Justice SCALIA’s Harris/Blockburger analysis could in theory produce. Suppose that the offense in question is failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer, see, e.g., Ind.Code § 9–21–8–1 (Supp.1992), and that the police officer’s order was, “Don’t shoot that man.” Under Justice SCALIA’s flawed reading of Harris, the elements of the offense of failure to obey a police officer’s lawful order would include, for purposes of Blockburger’s same-elements test, the elements of, perhaps, murder or manslaughter, in effect converting those felonies into a lesser included offense of the crime of failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer.
 
In sum, I think that the substantive criminal prosecutions in this case, which followed convictions for criminal contempt, *720 did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, at least before our decision in Grady. Under Grady, “the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a subsequent prosecution if, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted.” 495 U.S., at 510, 110 S.Ct., at 2087. As the Court points out, see ante, at 2860, this case undoubtedly falls within that expansive formulation: To secure convictions on the substantive criminal charges in this case, the Government will have to prove conduct that was the basis for the contempt convictions. Forced, then, to confront Grady, I join the Court in overruling that decision.
 



1
State v. Yancy, 4 N.C. 133 (1814), it should be noted, involved what is today called summary contempt. We have not held, and do not mean by this example to decide, that the double jeopardy guarantee applies to such proceedings.
2
In order for the same analysis to be applicable to violation of a statute criminalizing disobedience of a lawful police order, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent on this point hypothesizes, see post, at 2868, the statute must embrace police “orders” that “command” the noncommission of crimes—for instance, “Don't shoot that man!” It seems to us unlikely that a “police order” statute would be interpreted in this fashion, rather than as addressing new obligations imposed by lawful order of police (for example, the obligation to remain behind police lines, or to heed a command to “Freeze!”). If, however, such a statute were interpreted to cover police orders forbidding crimes, the Double Jeopardy Clause would as a practical matter bar subsequent prosecution only for relatively minor offenses, such as assault (the only conceivable lesser included offense of an order not to “shoot”)—unless one assumes that constables often order the noncommission of serious crimes (for example “Don't murder that man!”) and that serious felons such as murderers are first prosecuted for disobeying police orders.
3
It is not obvious that the word “assault” in the CPO bore the precise meaning “assault under § 22–504.” The court imposing the contempt construed it that way, however, and the point has not been contested in this litigation.
4
Justice WHITE complains that this section of our opinion gives the arguments of the United States “short shrift,” post, at 2869, and treats them in “conclusory” fashion, post, at 2869. He then proceeds to reject these arguments, largely by agreeing with our analysis, post, at 2869, 2870, 2871, 2872. We think it unnecessary, and indeed undesirable, to address at any greater length than we have arguments based on dictum and inapplicable doctrines such as dual sovereignty. The remainder of that part of Justice WHITE's opinion that deals with this issue argues—by no means in conclusory fashion—that its practical consequences for law enforcement are not serious. Post, at 2872–2874. He may be right. But we do not share his “pragmatic” view, post, at 2878, that the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause depends upon our approval of its consequences.
5
Given this requirement of willful violation of the order, Justice WHITE's desire to “put to the side the CPO,” because it only “triggered the court's authority” cannot be reconciled with his desire to “compar[e] the substantive offenses of which respondents stood accused.” Post, at 2876. The “substantive offense” of criminal contempt is willful violation of a court order. Far from a mere jurisdictional device, that order (or CPO) is the centerpiece of the entire proceeding. Its terms define the prohibited conduct, its existence supports imposition of a criminal penalty, and willful violation of it is necessary for conviction. To ignore the CPO when determining whether two offenses are the “same” is no more possible than putting aside the statutory definitions of criminal offenses. Of course, Justice WHITE's view that the elements of criminal contempt are essentially irrelevant for double jeopardy analysis does have precedent—albeit erroneous—in Grady's same-conduct test. Grady v. Corbin, 495 U.S. 508, 110 S.Ct. 2084, 109 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990). Justice SOUTER also ignores the knowledge element. Post, at 2878, n. 10.
6
We accept, as we ordinarily do, the construction of a District of Columbia law adopted by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. See, e.g., Pernell v. Southall Realty, 416 U.S. 363, 368–369, 94 S.Ct. 1723, 1726–1727, 40 L.Ed.2d 198 (1974). The construction here has sound support in the text of the statute. Compare D.C.Code Ann. § 22–501 (1989) (assault with intent to kill, rob, rape, or poison) with § 22–504 (assault).
7
Justice WHITE's suggestion, post, at 2878, that if Foster received a lesser-included-offense instruction on assault at his trial for assault with intent to kill, we would uphold a conviction on that lesser count is simply wrong. Under basic Blockburger analysis, Foster may neither be tried a second time for assault nor again convicted for assault, as we have concluded as to Count I (charging simple assault). Thus, Foster certainly does receive the “full constitutional protection to which he is entitled,” post, at 2878, n. 10: he may neither be tried nor convicted a second time for assault. That does not affect the conclusion that trial and conviction for assault with intent to kill are not barred. It merely illustrates the unremarkable fact that one offense (simple assault) may be an included offense of two offenses (violation of the CPO for assault, and assault with intent to kill) that are separate offenses under Blockburger.
8
We think it is highly artificial to interpret the CPO's prohibition of threatening “in any manner,” as Justice WHITE would interpret it, to refer only to threats that violate the District's criminal laws. Post, at 2875, n. 7. The only threats meeting that definition would have been threats to do physical harm, to kidnap, or to damage property. See D.C.Code Ann. §§ 22–507, 22–2307 (1989). Threats to stalk, to frighten, to cause intentional embarrassment, to make harassing phone calls, to make false reports to employers or prospective employers, to harass by phone calls or otherwise at work—to mention only a few of the additional threats that might be anticipated in this domestic situation—would not be covered. Surely “in any manner threaten” should cover at least all threats to commit acts that would be tortious under District of Columbia law (which would be consistent with the trial court's later reference to a “legal threat”). Thus, under our Blockburger analysis the aggravated threat counts and the assault-with-intent-to-kill count come out the same way.
9
Justice WHITE attempts to avoid this issue altogether because, in his view, it would be “injudicious” to consider the differences in Foster, not pressed by the Government, between the CPO restrictions and the alleged statutory offenses. Post, at 2879. Of course, these differences are pure facts, apparent on the face of the CPO and the indictment. They do not alter the question presented, which assumes only that the prosecuted conduct was the same, see supra, at 2854, not that the terms of the CPO and the statute were. Further, although the Government did not argue that the different counts in Foster should come out differently, it did argue (as we do) that they all should be evaluated under Blockburger and not Grady, see, e.g., Brief for United States 14–15, 42; and we are not aware of any principle that prevents us from accepting a litigant's legal theory unless we agree with the litigant on all the applications of the theory. The standard to be applied in determining the double-jeopardy effect of criminal charges based on the same conduct (Blockburger vs. Grady ) assuredly is included within the question presented. That makes Justice WHITE's citation of cases declining to consider legal issues not raised below wholly beside the point. Nor can we see any abuse of what Justice WHITE himself regards as a prudential limitation, when the evident factual difference between the charges and the CPO order is central to proper constitutional analysis.
10
Justice SOUTER has apparently been led astray by his misinterpretation of the word “incidents” in the following passage of Nielsen: “[W]here, as in this case, a person has been tried and convicted for a crime which has various incidents included in it, he cannot be a second time tried for one of those incidents without being twice put in jeopardy for the same offence.” 131 U.S., at 188, 9 S.Ct., at 676. He apparently takes “incident” to mean “event” or “conduct.” See post, at 2885, and n. 5, 2888. What it obviously means, however, is “element.” See Black's Law Dictionary 762 (6th ed. 1990) (defining “incidents of ownership”); J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 783–784 (1883) (defining “incident” and giving examples of “incident to a reversion,” and “incidents” to a contract). That is perfectly clear from the very next sentence of Nielsen (which Justice SOUTER does not quote): “It may be contended that adultery is not an incident of unlawful cohabitation....” 131 U.S., at 189, 9 S.Ct., at 676.
11
There is, for example, no other way to read the following passage in Illinois v. Vitale, quoted by Justice SOUTER, post, at 2888: “[In Harris ] we treated a killing in the course of a robbery as itself a separate statutory offense, and the robbery as a species of lesser-included offense.” 447 U.S. 410, 420, 100 S.Ct. 2260, 2267 (1980).
12
Justice SOUTER contends that Burton is not in point because the case arose on a demurrer to the indictment, so that the Court “was not presented with the factual basis for the charges.” Post, at 2888. It would be a rare and unsatisfactory indictment that did not set forth the factual basis for the charges. The Court in Burton discusses the facts at length. 202 U.S., at 379–381, 26 S.Ct., at 698–699. It is obvious, and it was assumed by the Court, that the same conduct was at issue in both indictments. Having decided, pursuant to Blockburger, that the nature of the statutes did not support a claim of double jeopardy, the Court (if it agreed with Justice SOUTER's view of the law) should have proceeded to consider whether the nature of the acts alleged supported such a claim.
13
Both Justice WHITE, post, at 2876, and Justice SOUTER, post, at 2884, recognize that Gavieres did hold that Blockburger is the only test for “same offence.” Justice SOUTER handles this difficulty by simply ignoring the concession. See post, at ibid. Justice WHITE first minimizes the concession, arguing that application of our version of Blockburger to successive prosecutions has happened (by reason of Gavieres ) “only once.” Post, at 2889. Once, it seems to us, is enough to make a precedent. Justice WHITE then seeks to neutralize the precedent by offering still another case, Grafton v. United States, 206 U.S. 333, 27 S.Ct. 749, 51 L.Ed. 1084 (1907), that cannot support the reading grafted onto it today. Post, at 2878–2879. The defendant in Grafton was first tried and acquitted by a military court for the offense of homicide, and then tried by a civilian criminal court for assassination, and convicted of homicide, based on the same conduct. 206 U.S., at 349, 27 S.Ct., at 753. The second prosecution was held barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Justice WHITE argues that, just as Grafton had to be a soldier for the military court to have jurisdiction, so too here the only relevance of the CPO is that it gave the court authority to punish offenses “already prescribed by the criminal law.” Post, at 2879. This description does not accurately portray the threat counts, see n. 8, supra—but the problem with Justice WHITE's analysis is deeper than that. The substantive offense for which Grafton was first tried (violation of Philippines Penal Code Article 404) did not have as one of its elements status as a soldier, whereas the substantive offense for which Foster was first tried did have as one of its elements knowledge of an extant CPO. See supra, at 2858–2859. Since military status was not an element of Grafton's charged offense, it is not true that our analysis would produce a result contrary to the opinion in Grafton. Under the traditional Blockburger elements test, assassination, as defined in Article 403 of the Philippines Penal Code, contained an element that homicide, as defined in Article 404, did not; but, as the Court noted, homicide did not contain any element not included in assassination. 206 U.S., at 350, 27 S.Ct., at 753 (“One crime may be a constituent part of the other”); accord, id., at 355, 27 S.Ct., at 755 (he “could not subsequently be tried for the same offense”). Grafton could therefore not later be prosecuted for assassination, much less later be convicted for the very same homicide offense of which he had been acquitted. (In fact, Grafton may simply have been decided on grounds of collateral estoppel, see id., at 349–351, 20 S.Ct., at 752–754, an issue that we specifically decline to reach in this case, see n. 17, infra.)
14
It is unclear what definition of “same offence” Justice SOUTER would have us adopt for successive prosecution. At times, he appears content with our having added to Blockburger the Grady same-conduct test. At other times, however, he adopts an ultra-Grady “same transaction” rule, which would require the Government to try together all offenses (regardless of the differences in the statutes) based on one event. See post, at 2883–2890. Of course, the same-transaction test, long espoused by Justice Brennan, see, e.g., Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 170, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2227, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977) (concurring opinion), has been consistently rejected by the Court. See, e.g., Garrett v. United States, 471 U.S. 773, 790, 105 S.Ct. 2407, 2417, 85 L.Ed.2d 764 (1985).
15
Justice SOUTER dislikes this result because it violates “the principles behind the protection from successive prosecutions included in the Fifth Amendment.” Post, at 2890. The “principles behind” the Fifth Amendment are more likely to be honored by following longstanding practice than by following intuition. But in any case, Justice SOUTER's concern that prosecutors will bring separate prosecutions in order to perfect their case seems unjustified. They have little to gain and much to lose from such a strategy. Under Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970), an acquittal in the first prosecution might well bar litigation of certain facts essential to the second one—though a conviction in the first prosecution would not excuse the Government from proving the same facts the second time. Surely, moreover, the Government must be deterred from abusive, repeated prosecutions of a single offender for similar offenses by the sheer press of other demands upon prosecutorial and judicial resources. Finally, even if Justice SOUTER's fear were well founded, no double jeopardy bar short of a same-transaction analysis will eliminate this problem; but that interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause has been soundly rejected, see, e.g., Garrett, supra, and would require overruling numerous precedents, the latest of which is barely a year old, United States v. Felix, 503 U.S. 378, 112 S.Ct. 1377, 118 L.Ed.2d 25 (1992).
16
See, e.g., Sharpton v. Turner, 964 F.2d 1284, 1287 (CA2) (Grady formulation “has proven difficult to apply” and “whatever difficulties we have previously encountered in grappling with the Grady language have not been eased by” Felix ), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 986, 113 S.Ct. 494, 121 L.Ed.2d 432 (1992); Ladner v. Smith, 941 F.2d 356, 362, 364 (CA5 1991) (a divided court adopts a four-part test for application of Grady and notes that Grady, “even if carefully analyzed and painstakingly administered, is not easy to apply”), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 983, 112 S.Ct. 1665, 118 L.Ed.2d 387 (1992); United States v. Calderone, 917 F.2d 717 (CA2 1990) (divided court issues three opinions construing Grady ), vacated and remanded, 503 U.S. 978, 112 S.Ct. 1657, 118 L.Ed.2d 381 (1992) (remanded for consideration in light of Felix ); United States v. Prusan, 780 F.Supp. 1431, 1434–1436 (SDNY 1991) (“[T]he lower courts have had difficulty discerning the precise boundaries of the Grady standard, and the circuits have not applied uniformly the ‘same conduct’ test”), rev'd, 967 F.2d 57 (CA2), cert. denied sub nom. Vives v. United States, 506 U.S. 987, 113 S.Ct. 497, 121 L.Ed.2d 434 (1992); State v. Woodfork, 239 Neb. 720, 725, 478 N.W.2d 248, 252 (1991) (divided court overrules year-old precedent construing Grady, because it was a “misapplication” of Grady ); Eatherton v. State, 810 P.2d 93, 99, 104 (Wyo.1991) (majority states that “[t]he Supreme Court did not really develop any new law in Grady with respect to successive prosecutions,” while dissent concludes that Grady requires reversal). Commentators have confirmed that Grady contributed confusion rather than certainty. See Poulin, Double Jeopardy Protection against Successive Prosecutions in Complex Criminal Cases: A Model, 25 Conn.L.Rev. 95 (1992); Thomas, A Modest Proposal to Save the Double Jeopardy Clause, 69 Wash.U.L.Q. 195 (1991).
