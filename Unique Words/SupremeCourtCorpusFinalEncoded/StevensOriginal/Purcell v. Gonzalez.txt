(No. 06A375 (06-532)), (No. 06A379 (06-533))

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

549 U.S. 1

October 20, 2006, Decided

JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.
Allowing the election to proceed without enjoining the statutory provisions at issue will provide the courts with a better record on which to judge their constitutionality. At least two important factual issues remain largely unresolved: the scope of the disenfranchisement that the novel identification requirements will produce, and the prevalence and character of the fraudulent practices that allegedly justify those requirements. Given the importance of the constitutional issues, the Court wisely takes action that will enhance the likelihood that they will be resolved correctly on the basis of historical facts rather than speculation.
