MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.

Before asking whether any of the recognized exceptions to the doctrine of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, make it appropriate for a federal court to exercise its jurisdiction to pass on the constitutionality of a state statute, the Court should first decide whether there is a legitimate basis for invoking the Younger doctrine at all. It has never been suggested that every pending proceeding between a State and a federal plaintiff justifies abstention unless one of the exceptions to Younger  [*436]  applies; for example, a pending charge that the federal plaintiff is  [**2384]  guilty of a traffic violation will not justify dismissal of a federal attack on the constitutionality of the State's child-abuse legislation.

The policy of equitable restraint expressed in Younger "is founded on the premise that ordinarily a pending state prosecution provides the accused a fair and sufficient [****39]  opportunity for vindication of federal constitutional rights." Kugler v. Helfant, 421 U.S. 117, 124. Since "no citizen or member of the community is immune from prosecution, in good faith, for his alleged criminal acts," Younger v. Harris, supra, at 46, there is no justification for intervention by a court of equity to rule on claims which may be raised as a defense to the criminal prosecution and which, if meritorious, will result in adequate relief in that forum. Moreover, in our federal system, intervention by a federal court with respect to the questions at issue in state proceedings carries with it additional costs in terms of comity and federalism, for it "can readily be interpreted as reflecting negatively upon the state court's ability to enforce constitutional principles." Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 604.

The District Court's conclusion that abstention was inappropriate in this case was based squarely on its finding "that there is for these plaintiffs no 'opportunity to fairly pursue their constitutional claims in an ongoing state proceeding.'" 1Link to the text of the note In the absence of such an opportunity,  [****40]   [***1012]  Younger is simply inapplicable. Its underlying concerns with comity, equity, and federalism, we have recognized, have little force or vitality where there is no single pending state proceeding in which the constitutional claims may be raised "as a defense" and  [*437]  effective relief secured. 2Link to the text of the note [****42]  "When no state criminal proceeding is pending at the time the federal complaint is filed, federal intervention does not result in duplicative legal proceedings or disruption of the state criminal justice system; nor can federal intervention, in that circumstance, be interpreted as reflecting negatively upon the state court's ability to enforce constitutional principles." Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 462. To be sure, it can be argued that whenever a federal court rules on the constitutionality of a state statute, it is making a decision that interferes with the operation of important state mechanisms, and performing a task that could equally be performed by a state court. See ante, at 427. But this sort of lesser affront to principles of comity and federalism is not one that justifies a federal court in refusing to exercise the jurisdiction [****41]  over federal claims that Congress has entrusted to it. As this Court has repeatedly held, if a constitutional violation is alleged, even with respect to the most important state statute, a plaintiff is free to bring his suit in federal court without any requirement that he first exhaust state judicial remedies. 3Link to the text of the note

In requiring abstention in this case, the Court, in my judgment, is departing from these well-established principles and extending Younger beyond its logical bounds. The Sims parents sought relief in federal  [**2385]  court after 42 days of "diligent efforts" to secure a hearing in state court in order to regain custody of their children. 4Link to the text of the note [****43]  Despite their efforts, they not only  [*438]  failed to regain custody, but also did not even have an opportunity to be heard in a state court. Their constitutional challenge in federal court was "directed primarily at the legality of the children's seizure and detention for a 42-day period without a hearing" and the statutory scheme which allowed this serious deprivation of liberty to occur. 5Link to the text of the note

The only proceeding pending in state court at the time they brought this suit was a "Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship" initiated by the Harris County Welfare Unit on April 5 pursuant to ch. 11 of the  [***1013]  Texas Family Code. 6Link to the text of the note As of the first hearing in federal court on May 5, the plaintiff-parents had yet to receive notice of this suit, let alone any actual hearing before the judge. Had the federal court not intervened, however, notice would eventually have been provided, assuming compliance with the statute, and an adversary hearing would eventually have taken place. But this does not mean that federal-court abstention was required or appropriate.

 [****44]  In the hearing to be afforded under ch. 11, the state court would be required to decide whether the children should be returned to the custody of their parents or whether their interests would be better served by alternative arrangements for their care. With limited exceptions, 7Link to the text of the note [****45]  the Simses' suit in  [*439]  federal court had nothing to do with that question. The issues raised by their federal complaint did not go to their fitness as parents or to their rights to permanent custody of their children. Rather, the thrust of their federal complaint was that the procedures employed by the State to gather information and to seize and retain the children pending the formal adversary hearing under ch. 11 violated the Constitution. 8Link to the text of the note

As to these constitutional claims, the hearing to be afforded in state court on parental fitness and permanent custody was virtually as irrelevant as a hearing on a traffic violation. It is clearly the case, and the majority does not suggest otherwise, that the Simses could not avoid losing custody of their children at that point by successfully arguing that the State had acted unconstitutionally in its initial seizure of the children, or that a hearing should have been afforded earlier. These claims could not be raised "as a defense to the ongoing proceedings," Juidice v. Vail, 430 U.S. 327, 330; 9Link to the text of the note nothing in the ch. 11 determinations  [**2386]  required the court to consider or pass upon the different issues that the Simses sought to raise in federal court.

 [****46]  It may well be, as the majority suggests, that the Simses could have raised their constitutional claims against the State, not in defense, but in the nature of permissive counterclaims. The findings of the District Court, however, suggest the contrary. 10Link to the text of the note  [***1014]  But even if Texas does allow a party to raise any and  [*440]  all claims against the other party -- no matter how unrelated -- in a single proceeding, it certainly does not mandate that he do so. Broadening the scope of the state litigation to encompass new and difficult issues could only complicate and delay the Simses' efforts to obtain a hearing on the merits of the State's complaint as promptly as possible. In the meantime, of course, custody of the children would remain with the State and the deprivation of the parents' interest in the integrity of the family unit would continue.

The Younger doctrine does [****47]  not require a litigant to pursue such an unwise and impractical course of litigation. Younger does not bar federal-court consideration of "an issue that could not be raised in defense of the criminal prosecution." Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 108 n. 9. 11Link to the text of the note [****48]  The considerations of comity, equity, and federalism underlying that doctrine are no more implicated by the Sims decision that claims unrelated to a pending state proceeding should be brought in federal rather than state court than they are by a similar decision in the absence of an unrelated state proceeding. If there is no requirement that federal plaintiffs initiate constitutional litigation in state rather than federal court in the first instance -- and this Court has repeatedly held that there is not 12Link to the text of the note -- then the coincidence of an unrelated state proceeding provides no justification for imposing such a requirement.

While this factor alone is sufficient to render the Younger doctrine inapplicable, there is an even more basic objection to its application here. Younger abstention in these circumstances does not merely deprive the plaintiffs of their right to initiate new claims in the forum of their choice. Far more seriously, it deprives them of any relief at all. For this state forum could not and did not afford plaintiffs the sufficient opportunity  [*441]  to vindicate their constitutional rights that is not only a predicate to a Younger dismissal, but also their entitlement under the Constitution.

The three Sims children were taken into custody by the Harris County Child Welfare Unit on March 25, 1976, based on a telephone report that one of the children was possibly the victim of child abuse. After "diligent" but unsuccessful efforts by the parents to be heard in state court, they finally went to federal court where, 42 days after they lost custody of their children, the Simses were heard for the first time in a court of law and their children were returned to  [****49]  them. 13Link to the text of the note [****50]   [***1015]  In due course, the federal court held that the state statutory procedures were defective because they did not provide for adequate notice to the parents, and did not provide for an adequate hearing whenever the State sought to retain custody for more than 10 days. Although other portions of the District Court decision as to the State's procedures are challenged by the appeal in this Court, the appellants have not questioned these aspects of the District  [**2387]  Court's judgment. 14Link to the text of the note It is therefore  [*442]  undisputed that the Texas procedures did not afford the parents a fair opportunity to vindicate their rights.

 [****51]  "[The] opportunity to raise and have timely decided by a competent state tribunal the federal issues involved," 15Link to the text of the note [****52]  is, of course, required to support a Younger dismissal. And in the circumstances of this case, it is also -- concededly -- required by the Due Process Clause. Here, such an opportunity was simply not available in the state-court system; the opportunity  [*443]  to be heard at a later ch. 11 hearing is, as the State accepts, too late to meet the requirements of due process and to afford relief as to the interim deprivation. By ordering abstention nonetheless, the majority is not only extending the Younger doctrine beyond its underlying premise, but is also implicitly sanctioning a deprivation of parental rights without procedural protections which, as  [***1016]  the State itself agrees, are constitutionally required. 16Link to the text of the note

In my judgment, there could be no serious criticism of a holding that the Younger doctrine could properly be invoked in this case to bar consideration of the limited and easily divisible aspects of the Simses' challenge which were directed at the procedures to be followed in the ch. 11 adversary hearing. 17Link to the text of the note That hearing would afford the parents "a fair and sufficient opportunity" to raise those claims, and there is no reason  [**2388]  why the State should not have been able, if it wished, to go forward with an adversary hearing in the April 5 suit.  [****53]  Were the Court's decision today so limited, it would be supported by its prior cases. But in going further and holding that the federal court should have abstained as to the legality of the State's prehearing procedures and practices, the Court is applying the Younger doctrine where it simply does not belong. The District Court's finding that plaintiffs did not have a fair opportunity to pursue these constitutional claims in an ongoing state proceeding is amply supported by the record and the concessions of the State. This finding should foreclose any claim that the Younger doctrine makes abstention appropriate. I respectfully dissent.

Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434, led to our unanimous summary affirmance of a holding that Younger v. Harris did not justify abstention. See Quern v. Hernandez, 440 U.S. 951.

Id., at 1185. These proceedings were suspended, apparently voluntarily, by the State on April 22, when the Department of Human Resources received notice of the federal suit. A second ch. 11 suit was later filed by the Department, with respect to Paul Sims alone, on May 14, after suit in federal court had been filed and the first hearing held. Whether that action could in any circumstances serve as a predicate for a Younger dismissal is a substantial question which the Court does not purport to address. See Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332.

In addition to their challenges to the practices and procedures afforded by the State prior to a final adversary hearing, the Simses also claimed that an attorney ad litem should be appointed for a child in any suit affecting the parent-child relationship and that, where the State sought conservatorship of a child or termination of the parent-child relationship, it should be required to prove its case by clear and convincing evidence. The second claim relates only to the rules governing the formal ch. 11 hearing; the first to that hearing as well as prior hearings which they claimed were required.

The majority does not address separately the question of the federal court's authority to order the children returned to custody of their parents pending the final state hearing. Since that order did not resolve the merits of any issue to be decided in the state proceeding under ch. 11, I see no basis for distinguishing that decision from the District Court's underlying holdings that the statutory scheme pursuant to which the children were seized and detained by the State is unconstitutional.

Specifically, the appellants do not challenge the validity of paragraphs 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the judgment entered by the District Court; these paragraphs read as follows:

"2. That the use of Section 11.11 (a)(4) in conjunction with Chapter 17 of Title 2 of the Texas Family Code to deprive parents of the custody of children for longer than ten (10) days measured from the date of the deprivation, without a full adversary hearing, is an unconstitutional application of said provision.

. . . .

"5. That Section 17.03 is unconstitutional on its face insofar as it fails to require the State to make all reasonable efforts to serve notice on the parents of the ex parte hearing to be held immediately after possession of a child is taken by the State.

"6. That Section 17.05 is unconstitutional on its face insofar as it fails to require the State to hold a full adversary hearing with adequate notice to the parents before possession of a child taken by the State can be retained by the State beyond ten (10) days.

"7. That Section 17.06 is unconstitutional on its face insofar as it fails to require the State to hold a full adversary hearing at the expiration of the ex parte order, if the State seeks to obtain an order to retain possession of the child beyond ten (10) days.

"8. That Section 34.05 (c) is unconstitutional on its face insofar as it fails to require notice to the parents and a hearing in which the State makes a showing that a court order allowing psychological or psychiatric examinations is necessary to aid in the investigation of the abuse or neglect before such an order is obtained." App. A-102 -- A-103.

Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U.S. 564, 577. In Gibson, the Court concluded that this predicate to a Younger dismissal was not present because of the District Court's conclusion -- on the merits of the plaintiffs' challenge -- that the State Board was incompetent to adjudicate the issues pending before it. The critical point was that "the administrative body itself was unconstitutionally constituted, and so not entitled to hear the charges filed against the appellees." 411 U.S., at 577. The case before us is analogous: if the District Court here is correct -- and the State accepts that it is, at least in part -- that the procedures afforded by the State after its seizure of the children fail to comport with the minimum requirements of due process, then there is no more reason to abstain in favor of an unconstitutionally limited opportunity than in favor of the unconstitutionally composed Board in Gibson . The availability of a later full hearing in state court does not cure the problem in either case. As the Court recognized in Gibson, a subsequent de novo hearing cannot undo the interim harm to constitutional rights. Id., at 577 n. 16. See also Juidice v. Vail, 430 U.S., at 340-341 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).

16Link to the location of the note in the document
In some sense, every Younger dismissal involves an implicit constitutional decision that remitting the federal plaintiff to defend in the state forum is not itself a deprivation of his constitutional rights. In Younger itself, the Court was careful to point out that "[no] citizen or member of the community is immune from prosecution, in good faith, for his alleged criminal acts." 401 U.S., at 46. The same cannot be said about the extended deprivation of custody of one's children without any form of notice or hearing.
