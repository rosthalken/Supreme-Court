JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN  [***265]  and JUSTICE POWELL join, dissenting.

Section 4945 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 4945, imposes a substantial excise tax on noncharitable expenditures by a private foundation. Transfers remain taxable under this section only as long as the organization retains its foundation status. Upon the termination of that status, tax liability is assessed pursuant to § 507(c). Petitioners are trustees and residuary legatees of a testamentary trust established in 1905 and later organized as a private foundation. In 1971, a Louisiana court ordered the dissolution  [*924]  of the trust and the distribution of its remaining assets to the settlor's heirs. The Internal Revenue Service acknowledged that the trust's § 507(c) liability was zero. Nonetheless, viewing the distributions as § 4945 "taxable expenditures" by a still extant foundation, it imposed a 100% excise tax on the transfer. Petitioners contested liability, and an action in Tax Court ensued. Concluding that the trust's private foundation status terminated upon the issuance of the state [****2]  court judgment, the court found for petitioners. 45 TCM 280, P82-707 P-H Memo TC (1982). A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that notwithstanding the prior dissolution of the trust and the absence of any § 507(c) liability whatever, the distribution qualified as a § 4945 taxable expenditure. 745 F. 2d 955 (1984). Because I seriously question whether the harsh result reached by the Court of Appeals is consistent with either the letter or  [**259]  intent of the relevant provisions of the Code, I would grant the petitions for certiorari.
