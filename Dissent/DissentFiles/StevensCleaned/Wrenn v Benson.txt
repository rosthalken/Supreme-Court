Because I believe the preparation and enforcement of orders of this kind consume more of the Court's valuable time than is consumed by the routine denial of frivolous motions and petitions, see In re McDonald, 489 U.S. 180, 185 (1989) (Brennan, J., dissenting); Brown v. Herald Co., 464 U.S. 928 (1983) (Brennan, J., dissenting); id., at 931 (Stevens, J., dissenting), I respectfully dissent.
