JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.

Whether or not the Government complied with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure  [**2106]  11(e), I agree that the error, if any, was not serious enough [****9]  to support a collateral attack under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(d) or 28 U. S. C. § 2255. The error here is "not a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice, nor an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure." Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424, 428 (1962). Nor has it resulted in "manifest injustice." Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(d). If the Government erred in failing to recommend affirmatively the proper sentence, the time to object was at the sentencing hearing or on direct appeal. "[There] is no basis here for allowing collateral attack 'to do service for an appeal.'" United States v. Timmreck, 441 U.S. 780, 784 (1979) (quoting Sunal v. Large, 332 U.S. 174, 178 (1947)).

Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.
