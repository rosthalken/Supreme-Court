CHERYL K. PLILER, WARDEN, Petitioner v. RICHARD HERMAN FORD

No. 03-221

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

542 U.S. 225

April 26, 2004, Argued 
June 21, 2004, Decided

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter joins, concurring in the judgment.
While I fully agree with the views expressed by Justice Ginsburg, post, at 235, 159 L. Ed. 2d, at 350 (2004), and Justice Breyer, post, at 237, 159 L. Ed. 2d, at 351 (dissenting opinions), I am persuaded that the judgment entered by the Court--remanding to the Ninth Circuit to determine the propriety of equitable tolling--is both consistent with those views and correct. I therefore concur in that judgment.
