
I join Parts I and IV of the Court’s opinion, and Part III except insofar as it relies upon legislative history. To hold that the more general provisions of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 establish a mode of liability for a particular category of offense by municipalities that is excluded from the closely related statute (42 U.S.C. § 1983) which deals more specifically with that precise category of offense would violate the rudimentary *739 principles of construction that the specific governs the general, and that, where text permits, statutes dealing with similar subjects should be interpreted harmoniously.

The plurality twice cites petitioner Jett's opening brief, ante, at 2710, as if it presents this question. Neither of the passages to which the plurality refers, however, even remotely suggests that Jett anticipated, let alone raised, the argument that respondent advanced for the first time in its own brief on the merits.

During the 1970's, we modified our approach to determining whether a statute contains an implied cause of action, announcing the following four-part test:
“First, is the plaintiff ‘one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted’—that is, does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff? Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one? Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff? And finally, is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law?” Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 78, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 2088, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975) (citations omitted), quoting Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby, 241 U.S., at 39, 36 S.Ct., at 484.
It would make no sense, however, to apply a test first enunciated in 1975 to a statute enacted in 1866. An inquiry into Congress' actual intent must take account of the interpretive principles in place at the time. See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 698–699, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1958–1959, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 375–378, 102 S.Ct. 1825, 1837–1839, 72 L.Ed.2d 182 (1982). See also Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transportation, 483 U.S. 468, 496, 107 S.Ct. 2941, 2958, 97 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (advising against construing a statute on the basis of an interpretive principle announced after the statute was passed). Thus, I would interpret § 1981 in light of the principle described in Rigsby, rather than the one described in Cort.
Application even of the test fashioned in Cort, however, would lead to the conclusion that Jett may bring a cause of action in damages against respondent under § 1981. Jett belongs to the special class of persons (those who have been discriminated against in the making of contracts) for whom the statute was created; all of the indicators of legislative intent point in the direction of an implied cause of action; such an action is completely consistent with the statute's purposes; and, in view of the fact that this Reconstruction-era legislation was in part designed to curtail the authority of the States, it would be unreasonable to conclude that this cause of action is one relegated to state law.

The Court's heavy emphasis on § 2 of the 1866 Act also ignores the fact that the modern-day descendant of § 1 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, includes no remedy or penalty at all. Section 2 of the 1866 Act now appears at 18 U.S.C. § 242, see United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 327, n. 10, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 1043, n. 10, 85 L.Ed. 1368 (1941), a part of the Code entirely separate from § 1981, and is applicable to provisions other than § 1981. These facts strongly argue against placing too much weight on the availability of criminal penalties in deciding whether § 1981 contains an implied cause of action.
The plurality's assertion that the 1866 Act created no original federal jurisdiction for civil actions based on the statute, see ante, at 2715, is similarly unavailing. The language of § 3 easily includes original jurisdiction over such suits, and we have in fact concluded as much. See Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 704–705, 93 S.Ct. 1785, 1793, 36 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973) (“The initial portion of § 3 of the Act established federal jurisdiction to hear, among other things, civil actions brought to enforce § 1”). In addition, the plurality's argument confuses the question of which courts (state or federal) will enforce a cause of action with whether a cause of action exists.

Several amici argue that we need not conclude that § 1983 impliedly repealed the cause of action furnished by § 1981 in order to decide that § 1983 provides the sole remedy for violations of § 1981. See Brief for International City Management Association et al. as Amici Curiae 18–19. Their theory is that an implied cause of action did not exist when the 1871 Act was passed, and that therefore one may argue that the 1871 Act furnished the only remedy for the 1866 Act without arguing that the later statute in any way repealed the earlier one. To support their premise, they observe, first, that it was not until the 1960's that courts recognized a private cause of action under § 1 of the 1866 Act. In doing so, they ignore our earlier cases approving actions brought directly under § 1981. See Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U.S. 24, 68 S.Ct. 847, 92 L.Ed. 1187 (1948). In any event, the relevance of the date on which we expressly recognized that one could bring a suit for damages directly under § 1 escapes me; that we did so in the 1960's does not suggest that we would not have done so had we faced the question in the 1860's.
Amici assert, in addition, that “[i]n recognizing an implied cause of action” under § 1981, we “rested in part on congressional actions that post-date the creation in 1871 of an explicit civil cause of action for violations of Section 1981.” Brief for International City Management Association et al. as Amici Curiae 19. It is true that Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 412, n. 1, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 2189, n. 1, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968), and Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U.S. 229, 238, 90 S.Ct. 400, 405, 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969), cited 28 U.S.C. § 1343(4) in support of federal jurisdiction over those cases. I do not understand, however, how this shows that the 1866 Act as originally enacted did not confer federal jurisdiction over actions to recover damages for violations of the statute. Moreover, even if the 1866 Act did not confer such jurisdiction, the jurisdictional question is separate from the question whether a cause of action may be inferred from the statute. Indeed, amici appear to recognize as much when they argue that although § 1 did not establish federal jurisdiction to hear civil actions based on the statute, Congress “left the task of civil enforcement to the state courts.” Brief for International City Management Association et al. as Amici Curiae 17. I cannot imagine what “civil enforcement” amici have in mind, unless it is the civil remedy that Jett seeks.

The one bright spot in today's decision is its reaffirmation of our holding in Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980).
