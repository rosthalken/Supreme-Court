Supreme Court of the United States
Wesley Aaron SHAFER, Jr., Petitioner,
v.
SOUTH CAROLINA
No. 00–5250.
|
Argued Jan. 9, 2001.
|
Decided March 20, 2001.
 

Justice SCALIA, dissenting.

While I concede that today’s judgment is a logical extension of Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994), I am more attached to the logic of the Constitution, whose Due Process Clause was understood as an embodiment of common-law tradition, rather than as authority for federal courts to promulgate wise national rules of criminal procedure.
 
As I pointed out in Simmons, that common-law tradition does not contain special jury-instruction requirements for capital cases. Today’s decision is the second page of the “whole new chapter” of our improvised “ ‘death-is-different’ jurisprudence” that Simmons began. Id., at 185, 114 S.Ct. 2187 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The third page (or the fourth or fifth) will be the (logical-enough) extension of this novel requirement to cases in which the jury did not inquire into the possibility of parole. Providing such information may well be a good idea (though it will sometimes harm rather than help the defendant’s case)—and many States have indeed required it. See App. B to Brief for Petitioner. The Constitution, however, does not. I would limit Simmons to its facts.
