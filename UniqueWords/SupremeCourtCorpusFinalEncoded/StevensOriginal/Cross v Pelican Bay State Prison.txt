RICHARD M. CROSS v. PELICAN BAY STATE PRISON ET AL.; RICHARD M. CROSS v. RICHARD WIEKING, CLERK, UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

Nos. 98-8486 and 98-8487

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

526 U.S. 811

May 24, 1999, Decided

JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
As I have suggested in the past, the Court uses more of its "limited resources" preparing, entering, and policing orders of this kind than it would by following a consistent policy of simply denying the many frivolous petitions that are filed by a large number of litigants. See Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U.S. 1, 4, 121 L. Ed. 2d 305, 113 S. Ct. 397 (1992) (STEVENS, J., dissenting), and cases cited. I respectfully dissent.
