LaROYCE LATHAIR SMITH, Petitioner v. TEXAS

No. 05-11304

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

127 S. Ct. 1686

January 17, 2007, Argued 
April 25, 2007, Decided

Justice Souter, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion. In some later case, we may be required to consider whether harmless-error review is ever appropriate in a case with error as described in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 109 S. Ct. 2934, 106 L. Ed. 2d 256 (1989). We do not and need not address that question here.
