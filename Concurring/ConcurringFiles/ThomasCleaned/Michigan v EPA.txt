
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) asks the Court to defer to its interpretation of the phrase “appropriate and necessary” in § 112(n)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7412. Justice SCALIA’s opinion for the Court demonstrates why EPA’s interpretation deserves no deference under our precedents. I write separately to note that its request for deference raises serious questions about the constitutionality of our broader practice of deferring to agency interpretations of federal statutes. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).
 
Chevron deference is premised on “a presumption that Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute meant for implementation by an agency, understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the agency, and desired the agency (rather than the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion the ambiguity allows.” Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U.S. 735, 740–741, 116 S.Ct. 1730, 135 L.Ed.2d 25 (1996). We most often describe Congress’ supposed choice to leave matters to agency discretion as an allocation of interpretive authority. See, e.g., National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U.S. 967, 983, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005) (referring to the agency as “the authoritative interpreter (within the limits of reason) of [ambiguous] statutes”). But we sometimes treat that discretion as though it were a form of legislative power. See, e.g., United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 229, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001) (noting that the agency “speak[s] with the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the enacted law” even when “ ‘Congress did not actually have an intent’ as to a particular result”). Either way, Chevron deference raises serious separation-of-powers questions.
 
As I have explained elsewhere, “[T]he judicial power, as originally understood, requires a court to exercise its independent judgment in interpreting and expounding upon the laws.” Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.S. ––––, ––––, 135 S.Ct. 1199, 1217, 191 L.Ed.2d 186 (2015) (opinion concurring in judgment). Interpreting federal statutes—including ambiguous ones administered by an agency—“calls for that exercise of independent judgment.” Id., at ––––, 135 S.Ct., at 1219. Chevron deference precludes judges from exercising that judgment, forcing them to abandon what they believe is “the best reading of an ambiguous statute” in favor of an agency’s construction. Brand X, supra, at 983, 125 S.Ct. 2688. It thus wrests from Courts the ultimate interpretative authority to “say what the law is,” Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803), and hands it over to the Executive. See Brand X, supra, at 983, 125 S.Ct. 2688 (noting that the judicial construction of an ambiguous statute is “not authoritative”). Such a transfer is in tension with Article III’s Vesting Clause, which vests the judicial power exclusively in Article III courts, not administrative agencies. U.S. Const., Art. III, § 1.
 
In reality, as the Court illustrates in the course of dismantling EPA’s interpretation of § 112(n)(1)(A), agencies “interpreting”  *2713 ambiguous statutes typically are not engaged in acts of interpretation at all. See, e.g., ante, at 2708. Instead, as Chevron itself acknowledged, they are engaged in the “ ‘formulation of policy.’ ” 467 U.S., at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Statutory ambiguity thus becomes an implicit delegation of rule-making authority, and that authority is used not to find the best meaning of the text, but to formulate legally binding rules to fill in gaps based on policy judgments made by the agency rather than Congress.
 
Although acknowledging this fact might allow us to escape the jaws of Article III’s Vesting Clause, it runs headlong into the teeth of Article I’s, which vests “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted” in Congress. U.S. Const., Art. I, § 1. For if we give the “force of law” to agency pronouncements on matters of private conduct as to which “ ‘Congress did not actually have an intent,’ ” Mead, supra, at 229, 121 S.Ct. 2164, we permit a body other than Congress to perform a function that requires an exercise of the legislative power. See Department of Transportation v. Association of American Railroads, 575 U.S. ––––, –––– – ––––, 135 S.Ct. 1225, 1251–1252, 191 L.Ed.2d 153 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).
 
These cases bring into bold relief the scope of the potentially unconstitutional delegations we have come to countenance in the name of Chevron deference. What EPA claims for itself here is not the power to make political judgments in implementing Congress’ policies, nor even the power to make tradeoffs between competing policy goals set by Congress, American Railroads, supra, at –––– – ––––, 135 S.Ct., at 1250–1252 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (collecting cases involving statutes that delegated this legislative authority). It is the power to decide—without any particular fidelity to the text—which policy goals EPA wishes to pursue. Should EPA wield its vast powers over electric utilities to protect public health? A pristine environment? Economic security? We are told that the breadth of the word “appropriate” authorizes EPA to decide for itself how to answer that question. Compare 77 Fed.Reg. 9327 (2012) (“[N]othing about the definition [of “appropriate”] compels a consideration of costs” (emphasis added)) with Tr. of Oral Arg. 42 (“[T]he phrase appropriate and necessary doesn’t, by its terms, preclude the EPA from considering cost” (emphasis added)).1
 
Perhaps there is some unique historical justification for deferring to federal agencies, see Mead, supra, at 243, 121 S.Ct. 2164 (SCALIA, J., dissenting), but these cases reveal how paltry an effort we have made to understand it or to confine ourselves to its boundaries. Although we hold today that EPA exceeded even the extremely permissive limits on agency power set by our precedents, we should be alarmed that it felt sufficiently emboldened by those precedents to make the bid for deference that it did here.2 As in other areas of our jurisprudence concerning administrative *2714 agencies, see, e.g., B & B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., 575 U.S. ––––, –––– – ––––, 135 S.Ct. 1293, 1315–1318, 191 L.Ed.2d 222 (2015) (THOMAS, J., dissenting), we seem to be straying further and further from the Constitution without so much as pausing to ask why. We should stop to consider that document before blithely giving the force of law to any other agency “interpretations” of federal statutes.

I can think of no name for such power other than “legislative power.” Had we deferred to EPA's interpretation in these cases, then, we might have violated another constitutional command by abdicating our check on the political branches—namely, our duty to enforce the rule of law through an exercise of the judicial power. Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.S. ––––, –––– – ––––, 135 S.Ct. 1199, 1220–1221, 191 L.Ed.2d 186 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).

This is not the first time an agency has exploited our practice of deferring to agency interpretations of statutes. See, e.g., Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., ––– U.S. ––––, 135 S.Ct. 2507, ––– L.Ed.2d ––––, 2015 WL 2473449 (2015) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).
