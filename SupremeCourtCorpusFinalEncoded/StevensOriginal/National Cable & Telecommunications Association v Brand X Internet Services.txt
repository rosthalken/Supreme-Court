SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

545 U.S. 967

March 29, 2005, Argued 
June 27, 2005, Decided

Justice Stevens, concurring.
While I join the Court's opinion in full, I add this caveat concerning Part III-B, which correctly explains why a court of appeals' interpretation of an ambiguous provision in a regulatory statute does not foreclose a contrary reading by the agency. That explanation would not necessarily be applicable to a decision by this Court that would presumably remove any pre-existing ambiguity.
