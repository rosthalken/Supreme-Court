Supreme Court of the United States
GREEN TREE FINANCIAL CORP., nka Conseco Finance Corp., Petitioner,
v.
Lynn W. BAZZLE, et al., in a representative capacity on behalf of a class and for all others similarly situated, et al.
No. 02-634.
|
Argued April 22, 2003.
|
Decided June 23, 2003.
Justice THOMAS, dissenting.

I continue to believe that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., does not apply to proceedings in state courts. Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U.S. 265, 285-297, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753 (1995) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). See also Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U.S. 681, 689, 116 S.Ct. 1652, 134 L.Ed.2d 902 (1996) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). For that reason, the FAA cannot be a ground for pre-empting a state court’s interpretation of a private arbitration agreement. Accordingly, I would leave undisturbed the judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina.
