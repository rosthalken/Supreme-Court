Justice Breyer, dissenting.

I agree with the Court that further consideration is warranted, and I am pleased that the stay is time limited. However, I would undertake that consideration without a temporary stay in place. This stay prohibits the transmission of proceedings to other federal courthouses. In my view, the Court's standard for granting a stay is not met. See Conkright v. Frommert, 556 U. S.    ,     556 U.S. 1401, 129 S. Ct. 1861, 173 L. Ed. 2d 865 (2009) (slip op., at 1-2) (Ginsburg, J., in chambers).  [*2] In particular, the papers filed, in my view, do not show a likelihood of "irreparable harm."

With respect, I dissent.
