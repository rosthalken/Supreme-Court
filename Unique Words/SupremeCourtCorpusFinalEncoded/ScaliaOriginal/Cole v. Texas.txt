499 U.S. 1301
TED CALVIN COLE v. TEXAS
Supreme Court of the United States
March 18, 1991, Decided
No. A-704 (90-7411)

JUSTICE SCALIA, Circuit Justice.

I have before me an application for a stay of execution pending disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas. The petitioner seeks direct review of the judgment of the Texas courts affirming his death sentence.

I will in this case, and in every capital case on direct review, grant a stay of execution pending disposition by this Court of the petition for certiorari. While I will not extend the time for filing a petition beyond an established execution date, see Madden v. Texas, 498 U.S. 1301 (1991) (Scalia, J., in chambers), neither will I permit the State's execution date  [**1408]  to interfere with the orderly processing of a petition on direct [****2]  review by this Court.

It is so ordered.
