
Advancing price impact consideration from the merits stage to the certification stage may broaden the scope of discovery available at certification. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-37. But the Court recognizes that it is incumbent upon the defendant to show the absence of price impact. See ante, at ___ - ___, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 357. The Court’s judgment, therefore,    should impose no heavy toll on securities-fraud plaintiffs with tenable claims. On that understanding, I join the Court’s opinion.
