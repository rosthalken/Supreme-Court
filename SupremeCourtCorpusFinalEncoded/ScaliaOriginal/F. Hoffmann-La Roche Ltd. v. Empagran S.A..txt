542 U.S. 155
F. HOFFMANN-La ROCHE LTD, et al., Petitioners v. EMPAGRAN S.A. et al.
Supreme Court of the United States
April 26, 2004, Argued ; June 14, 2004, Decided
No. 03-724

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the judgment.

I concur in the judgment of the Court because the language of the statute is readily susceptible of the interpretation the Court provides and because only that interpretation is consistent with the principle that statutes should be read in accord with the customary deference to the application of foreign countries' laws within their own territories.
