
In my view the Ninth Circuit’s opinion purported to apply the standard for summary judgment that today’s opinion demands. Its error was in finding, on the facts before it, that the standard was not met. Since I think it worthwhile to establish that this Court will not let such a mistake stand with respect to those who guard the life of the President, I concur in the summary reversal.
