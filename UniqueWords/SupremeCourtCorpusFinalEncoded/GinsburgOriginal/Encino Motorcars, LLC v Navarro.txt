JUSTICE Ginsburg, with whom JUSTICE Sotomayor joins, concurring.

I agree in full that, in issuing its 2011 rule, the Department of Labor did not satisfy its basic obligation to explain “that there are good reasons for [a] new policy.” FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515, 129 S. Ct. 1800, 173 L. Ed. 2d 738 (2009). The Department may have adequate reasons to construe the Fair Labor Standards Act automobile-dealership exemption as it did. The 2011 rulemaking tells us precious little, however, about what those reasons are. 1Link to the text of the note

 [*2128]  I write separately to stress that nothing in today’s opinion disturbs well-established law. In particular, where an agency has departed from a prior position, there is no “heightened standard” of arbitrary-and-capricious  [**396]  review. Id., at 514, 129 S. Ct. 1800, 173 L. Ed. 2d 738. See also ante, at ___, 195 L. Ed. 2d, at 393. An agency must “display awareness that it is changing position” and “show that there are good reasons for the new policy.” Fox, 556 U.S., at 515, 129 S. Ct. 1800, 173 L. Ed. 2d 738 (emphasis deleted). “But it need not demonstrate [***23]  to a court’s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the old one; it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better, which the conscious change of course adequately indicates.” Ibid.

The Court’s bottom line remains unaltered: “‘[U]nexplained inconsistency’ in agency policy is ‘a reason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice.’” Ante, at ___, 195 L. Ed. 2d, at 393 (quoting National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U.S. 967, 981, 981, 125 S. Ct. 2688, 162 L. Ed. 2d 820 (2005)). Industry reliance may spotlight the inadequacy of an agency’s explanation. See ante, at ___, 195 L. Ed. 2d, at 393 (“decades of industry reliance” make “summary discussion” inappropriate). But reliance does not overwhelm good reasons for a policy change. Even if the Department’s changed position would “necessitate systemic, significant changes to the dealerships’ compensation arrangements,” ante, at ___, 195 L. Ed. 2d, at 394, the Department would not be disarmed from determining that the benefits of overtime coverage outweigh those costs. 2Link to the text of the note “If the action rests upon . . . an exercise of judgment in an area which Congress has entrusted to the agency[,] of course it must not be set aside because the reviewing court [***24]  might  [*2129]  have made a different determination were it empowered to do so.” SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94, 63 S. Ct. 454, 87 L. Ed. 626 (1943).

Unlike JUSTICE Thomas, I am not persuaded that, sans Chevron, the Ninth Circuit should conclude on remand that service advisors are categorically exempt from hours regulations. As that court previously explained, “[s]ervice advisors may be ‘salesmen’ in a generic sense, but they [may fall outside the exemption because they] do not personally sell cars and they do not personally [***22]  service cars.” 780 F. 3d 1267, 1274 (2015). Moreover, in its briefing before this Court, the Department of Labor responded to the argument that “the exemption’s application to a ‘partsman’” “confirm[s] that a service advisor is a salesman primarily engaged in servicing automobiles.” Post, at ___ - ___, 195 L. Ed. 2d, at 397-399 (Thomas, J, dissenting). See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22-23 (maintaining that partsmen, unlike service advisors, actually engage in maintenance and repair work); Brief for Respondents 11 (contending that partsmen “ge[t] their hands dirty” by “work[ing] as a mechanic’s right-hand man or woman”); id., at 32-35 (cataloguing descriptions of partsmen responsibilities drawn from occupational handbooks and training manuals). The Court appropriately leaves the proper ranking of service advisors to the Court of Appeals in the first instance.

If the Department decides to reissue the 2011 rule, I doubt that reliance interests would pose an insurmountable obstacle. As the Court acknowledges, ante, at ___, 195 L. Ed. 2d, at 394, an affirmative defense in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) protects regulated parties against retroactive liability for actions taken in good-faith reliance on superseded agency guidance, 29 U.S.C. §259(a). And a separate FLSA exemption covers many service advisors: retail or service workers who receive at least half of their pay on commission, so long as their regular rate of pay is more than 1½ times the minimum wage. Ante, at ___, 195 L. Ed. 2d, at 394 (citing §207(i)); see Brief for Petitioner 13, n. 4 (many service advisors are paid on a commission basis). Thus, the cost of the Department’s policy shift may be considerably less than the dealerships project. Finally, I note, the extent to which the Department is obliged to address reliance will be affected by the thoroughness of public comments it receives on the issue. In response to its 2008 proposal, the Department received only conclusory references to industry reliance interests. See ante, at ___, 195 L. Ed. 2d, at 394 (citing comment from National Automobile [***25]  Dealers Association). An agency cannot be faulted for failing to discuss at length matters only cursorily raised before it.
