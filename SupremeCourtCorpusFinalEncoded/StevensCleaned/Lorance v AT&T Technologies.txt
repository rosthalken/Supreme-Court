Although I remain convinced that the Court misconstrued Title VII in American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, 456 U.S. 63 (1982), see id., at 86-90 (dissenting opinion), and in Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250 (1980), see id., at 265-267 (dissenting opinion), the Court has correctly applied those decisions to the case at hand. And it is the Court's construction of the statute -- rather than the views of an individual Justice -- that becomes a part of the law. See Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, 480 U.S. 616, 644 (1987) (Stevens, J., concurring); Dougherty County Bd. of Education v. White, 439 U.S. 32, 47 (1978) (Stevens, J., concurring). Accordingly, I join the Court's opinion.
