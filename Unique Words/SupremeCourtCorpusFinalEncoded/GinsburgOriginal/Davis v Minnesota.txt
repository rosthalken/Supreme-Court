JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring in denial of certiorari.

I write only to note that the dissent's portrayal of the opinion of the Minnesota Supreme Court is incomplete. That court made two key observations: (1) "Religious affiliation (or lack thereof) is not as self-evident as race or gender," State v. Davis, 504 N.W.2d 767, 771 (Minn. 1993); (2) "Ordinarily . . . , inquiry on voir dire into a juror's religious affiliation and beliefs is irrelevant and prejudicial,  [*1116]  and to ask such questions is improper." Id., at 772 (adding that "proper questioning . . . should be limited to asking jurors if they knew of any reason why they could not sit,  [****2]  if they would have any difficulty in following the law as given by the court, or if they would have any difficulty in sitting in judgment").
