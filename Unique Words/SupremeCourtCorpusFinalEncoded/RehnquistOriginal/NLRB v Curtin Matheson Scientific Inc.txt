*797 Chief Justice REHNQUIST, concurring.

The Board’s “no-presumption” rule seems to me to press to the limit the deference to which the Board is entitled in assessing industrial reality, but for the reasons stated in the opinion of the Court I agree that limit is not exceeded. The Court of Appeals did not consider, free from the use of any presumption, whether there was substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the **1555 Board’s determination here, and I believe that is a question best left for the Court of Appeals on remand.
 
By refusing to allow the employer to resort to what would seem to be commonsense assumptions about the views of an entire class of workers-those hired to replace strikers-the Board sharply limits the means by which an employer might satisfy the “good-faith doubt” requirement. Although the Board’s opinion in this case does not preclude a finding of good-faith doubt based on circumstantial evidence, some recent decisions suggest that it now requires an employer to show that individual employees have “expressed desires” to repudiate the incumbent union in order to establish a reasonable doubt of the union’s majority status. See Tube Craft, Inc., 289 N.L.R.B. 862, n. 2 (1988); Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 289 N.L.R.B. 358, 361 (1988); Tile, Terrazzo & Marble Contractors Assn., 287 N.L.R.B. 769, n. 2 (1987). It appears that another of the Board’s rules prevents the employer from polling its employees unless it first establishes a good-faith doubt of majority status. See Texas Petrochemicals Corp., 296 N.L.R.B. No. 1057, 1064 (1989) (the standard for employer polling is the same as the standard for withdrawal of recognition). I have considerable doubt whether the Board may insist that good-faith doubt be determined only on the basis of sentiments of individual employees, and at the same time bar the employer from using what might be the only effective means of determining those sentiments. But that issue is not before us today.
