We held in Booth v. Maryland, 482 U. S. 496, 107 S. Ct. 2529, 96 L. Ed. 2d 440 (1987), that the Eighth Amendment prohibits a court from admitting the opinions of the victim’s family members about the appropriate sentence in a capital case. The Court today correctly observes that our decision in Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 111 S. Ct. 2597, 115 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1991), did not expressly overrule this aspect of Booth. Because “it is this Court’s prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents,” State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20, 118 S. Ct. 275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997), the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals erred in holding that Payne invalidated Booth in its entirety. In vacating the decision below, this Court says nothing about whether Booth was correctly decided or whether Payne swept away its analytical foundations. I join the Court’s opinion with this understanding.
