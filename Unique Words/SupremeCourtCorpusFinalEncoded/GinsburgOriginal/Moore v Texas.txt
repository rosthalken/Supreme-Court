Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.

Bobby James Moore fatally shot a store clerk during a botched robbery. He was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. Moore challenged his death sentence on the ground that he was intellectually disabled and therefore exempt from execution. A state habeas court made detailed factfindings and determined that, under this Court’s decisions in Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335 (2002), and Hall v. Florida, 572 U. S. ___ , 134 S. Ct. 1986, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007 (2014), Moore qualified as intellectually disabled. For that reason, the court concluded, Moore’s death sentence violated the Eighth Amendment’s proscription of “cruel and unusual punishments.” The habeas court therefore recommended that Moore be granted relief.

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) 1Link to the text of the note declined to adopt the judgment recommended by the state habeas court. 2Link to the text of the note In the CCA’s view, the habeas court erroneously employed intellectual-disability guides currently used in the medical community rather than the 1992 guides adopted by the CCA in Ex parte Briseno, 135 S. W. 3d 1 (2004). See Ex parte Moore, 470 S. W. 3d 481, 486-487 (2015). The appeals court further determined that the evidentiary factors announced in Briseno “weigh[ed] heavily” against upsetting Moore’s death sentence. 470 S. W. 3d, at 526.

We vacate the CCA’s judgment. As we instructed in Hall, adjudications of intellectual disability should be “informed by the views of medical experts.” 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 2000, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1025 ; see id., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 2000, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007. That instruction cannot sensibly be read to give courts leave to diminish the force of the medical community’s consensus. Moreover, the several factors Briseno set out as indicators of intellectual disability are an invention of the CCA untied to any acknowledged source. Not aligned with the medical community’s information, and drawing no strength from our precedent, the Briseno factors “creat[e] an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed,” 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1990, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1014 . Accordingly, they may not be used, as the CCA used them, to restrict qualification of an individual as intellectually disabled.



I
In April 1980, then-20-year-old Bobby James Moore and two others were engaged in robbing a grocery store. Ex parte Moore, 470 S. W. 3d 481, 490-491  [**422]  (Tex. Crim. App. 2015); App. 58. During the episode, Moore fatally shot a store clerk. 470 S. W. 3d, at 490. Some two months later, Moore was convicted and sentenced to death. See id., at 492. A federal habeas court later vacated that  [*1045]  sentence based on ineffective assistance of trial counsel, see Moore v. Collins, 1995 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 22859, *35 (SD Tex., Sept. 29, 1995), and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, see Moore v. Johnson, 194 F. 3d 586, 622 (1999). Moore was resentenced to death in 2001, and the CCA affirmed on direct appeal. See Moore v. State, 2004 Tex. Crim. App. Unpub. LEXIS 11 , 2004 WL 231323, *1 (Jan. 14, 2004), cert. denied, 543 U. S. 931 (2004).

Moore subsequently sought state habeas relief. In 2014, the state habeas court conducted a two-day hearing on whether Moore was intellectually disabled. See Ex parte Moore, No. 314483-C (185th Jud. Dist., Harris Cty., Tex., Feb. 6, 2015), App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a. The court received affidavits and heard testimony from Moore’s family members, former counsel, and a number of court-appointed mental-health experts. The evidence revealed that Moore had significant mental and social difficulties beginning at an early age. At 13, Moore lacked basic understanding of the days of the week, the months of the year, and the seasons; he could scarcely tell time or comprehend the standards of measure or the basic principle that subtraction is the reverse of addition. Id., at 187a. At school, because of his limited ability to read and write, Moore could not keep up with lessons. Id., at 146a, 182a-183a. Often, he was separated from the rest of the class and told to draw pictures. Ibid. Moore’s father, teachers, and peers called him “stupid” for his slow reading and speech. Id., at 146a, 183a. After failing every subject in the ninth grade, Moore dropped out of high school. Id., at 188a. Cast out of his home, he survived on the streets, eating from trash cans, even after two bouts of food poisoning. Id., at 192a-193a.

In evaluating Moore’s assertion of intellectual disability, the state habeas court consulted current medical diagnostic standards, relying on the 11th edition of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) clinical manual, see AAIDD, Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports (2010) (hereinafter AAIDD-11), and on the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), see APA, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (2013) (hereinafter DSM-5). App. to Pet. for Cert. 150a-151a, 202a. The court followed the generally accepted, uncontroversial intellectual-disability diagnostic definition, which identifies three core elements: (1) intellectual-functioning deficits (indicated by an IQ score “approximately two standard deviations below the mean”—i.e., a score of roughly 70—adjusted for “the standard error of measurement,” AAIDD-11, at 27); (2) adaptive deficits (“the inability to learn basic skills and adjust behavior to changing circumstances,” Hall v. Florida, 572 U. S. ___, ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1994, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1018 (2014) ); and (3) the onset of these deficits while still a minor. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 150a (citing AAIDD-11, at 1).  [**423]  See also Hall, 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007. 3Link to the text of the note

Moore’s IQ scores, the habeas court determined, established subaverage intellectual functioning. The court credited six of Moore’s IQ scores, the average of which (70.66) indicated mild intellectual disability. App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a-170a. 4Link to the text of the note  [*1046]  And relying on testimony from several mental-health experts, the habeas court found significant adaptive deficits. In determining the significance of adaptive deficits, clinicians look to whether an individual’s adaptive performance falls two or more standard deviations below the mean in any of the three adaptive skill sets (conceptual, social, and practical). See AAIDD-11, at 43. Moore’s performance fell roughly two standard deviations below the mean in all three skill categories. App. to Pet. for Cert. 200a-201a. Based on this evidence, the state habeas court recommended that the CCA reduce Moore’s sentence to life in prison or grant him a new trial on intellectual disability. See id., at 203a.

The CCA rejected the habeas court’s recommendations and denied Moore habeas relief. See 470 S. W. 3d 481. At the outset of its opinion, the CCA reaffirmed Ex parte Briseno, 135 S. W. 3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004), as paramount precedent on intellectual disability in Texas capital cases. See 470 S. W. 3d, at 486-487. Briseno adopted the definition of, and standards for assessing, intellectual disability contained in the 1992 (ninth) edition of the American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) manual, predecessor to the current AAIDD-11 manual. See 135 S. W. 3d, at 7 (citing AAMR, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports (9th ed. 1992) (hereinafter AAMR-9)).

Briseno incorporated the AAMR-9’s requirement that adaptive deficits be “related” to intellectual-functioning deficits. 135 S. W. 3d, at 7 (quoting AAMR-9, at 25). 5Link to the text of the note To determine whether a defendant has satisfied the relatedness requirement, the CCA instructed in this case, Texas courts should attend to the “seven evidentiary factors” first set out in Briseno. 470 S. W. 3d, at 489. 6Link to the text of the note No citation to any authority, medical or judicial, accompanied  [**424]  the Briseno court’s recitation of the seven factors. See 135 S. W. 3d, at 8-9.

The habeas judge erred, the CCA held, by “us[ing] the most current position, as espoused by AAIDD, regarding the diagnosis of intellectual disability rather than the test . . . in Briseno.” 470 S. W. 3d, at 486. This Court’s decision in Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335 (2002), the CCA emphasized, “left it to the States to develop appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction” on the execution of the intellectually disabled. 470 S. W. 3d, at 486. Thus, even though “[i]t may be true that the AAIDD’s and APA’s positions regarding the diagnosis  [*1047]  of intellectual disability have changed since Atkins and Briseno,” the CCA retained Briseno’s instructions, both because of “the subjectivity surrounding the medical diagnosis of intellectual disability” and because the Texas Legislature had not displaced Briseno with any other guideposts. 470 S. W. 3d, at 486-487. The Briseno inquiries, the court said, “remai[n] adequately ‘informed by the medical community’s diagnostic framework.’” 470 S. W. 3d, at 487 (quoting Hall, 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 2000, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1025).

Employing Briseno, the CCA first determined that Moore had failed to prove significantly subaverage intellectual functioning. 470 S. W. 3d, at 514-519. Rejecting as unreliable five of the seven IQ tests the habeas court had considered, the CCA limited its appraisal to Moore’s scores of 78 in 1973 and 74 in 1989. Id., at 518-519. The court then discounted the lower end of the standard-error range associated with those scores. Id., at 519; see infra, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 426-427 (describing standard error of measurement). Regarding the score of 74, the court observed that Moore’s history of academic failure, and the fact that he took the test while “exhibit[ing] withdrawn and depressive behavior” on death row, might have hindered [***14]  his performance. 470 S. W. 3d, at 519. Based on the two scores, but not on the lower portion of their ranges, the court concluded that Moore’s scores ranked “above the intellectually disabled range” (i.e., above 70). Ibid.; see id., at 513.

“Even if [Moore] had proven that he suffers from significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning,” the court continued, he failed to prove “significant and related limitations in adaptive functioning.” Id., at 520. True, the court acknowledged, Moore’s and the State’s experts agreed that Moore’s adaptive-functioning test scores fell more than two standard deviations below the mean. Id., at 521; see supra, at ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 422. But the State’s expert ultimately discounted those test results because Moore had “no exposure” to certain tasks the testing included, “such as writing a check and using a microwave oven.” 470 S. W. 3d, at 521-522. Instead, the expert emphasized Moore’s adaptive strengths in school, at trial, and in prison. Id., at 522-524.

The CCA credited the state expert’s appraisal. Id., at 524. The habeas court, the CCA concluded, had erred by concentrating on Moore’s adaptive weaknesses. Id., at 489. Moore had  [**425]  demonstrated adaptive strengths, the CCA spelled out, by living on the streets, playing pool and mowing lawns for money, committing the crime [***15]  in a sophisticated way and then fleeing, testifying and representing himself at trial, and developing skills in prison. Id., at 522-523. Those strengths, the court reasoned, undercut the significance of Moore’s adaptive limitations. Id., at 524-525.

The habeas court had further erred, the CCA determined, by failing to consider whether any of Moore’s adaptive deficits were related to causes other than his intellectualfunctioning deficits. Id., at 488, 526. Among alternative causes for Moore’s adaptive deficits, the CCA suggested, were an abuse-filled childhood, undiagnosed learning disorders, multiple elementary-school transfers, racially motivated harassment and violence at school, and a history of academic failure, drug abuse, and absenteeism. Ibid. Moore’s significant improvement in prison, in the CCA’s view, confirmed that his academic and social difficulties were not related to intellectual-functioning deficits. Ibid. The court then examined each of the seven Briseno evidentiary factors, see supra, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 423-424, and n. 6, concluding that those factors “weigh[ed] heavily” against  [*1048]  finding that Moore had satisfied the relatedness requirement. 470 S. W. 3d, at 526-527.

Judge Alcala dissented. Atkins and Hall, she would have held, require courts to consult current medical [***16]  standards to determine intellectual disability. 470 S. W. 3d, at 530. She criticized the majority for relying on manuals superseded in the medical community, id., at 530-534, 536-539, and for disregarding the habeas court’s credibility determinations, id., at 535-536, 538-539. Judge Alcala questioned the legitimacy of the seven Briseno factors, recounting wide criticism of the factors and explaining how they deviate from the current medical consensus. See 470 S. W. 3d, at 529-530, and n. 5. Most emphatically, she urged, the CCA “must consult the medical community’s current views and standards in determining whether a defendant is intellectually disabled”; “reliance on . . . standard[s] no longer employed by the medical community,” she objected, “is constitutionally unacceptable.” Id., at 533.

We granted certiorari to determine whether the CCA’s adherence to superseded medical standards and its reliance on Briseno comply with the Eighth Amendment and this Court’s precedents. 578 U. S. ___, 136 S. Ct. 2407, 195 L. Ed. 2d 779 (2016).

HN1 The Eighth Amendment prohibits “cruel and unusual punishments,” and “reaffirms the duty of the government to respect the dignity of all persons,” Hall, 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1992, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1016 (quoting Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 560, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2005)). “To enforce the Constitution’s protection of human dignity,” we “loo[k] to the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,” recognizing that “[t]he Eighth Amendment is not fastened to the obsolete.” [***17]  Hall, 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1992, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1016 (internal quotation marks omitted).

HN2 In Atkins v. Virginia, we held that the Constitution “restrict[s] . . . the State’s power to take the life of” any intellectually disabled individual.  [**426]  536 U. S., at 321, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335. See also Hall, 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007; Roper, 543 U. S., at 563-564, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1. Executing intellectually disabled individuals, we concluded in Atkins, serves no penological purpose, see 536 U. S., at 318-320, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335; runs up against a national consensus against the practice, see id., at 313-317, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335; and creates a “risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty,” id., at 320, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id., at 320-321, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335.

HN3 In Hall v. Florida, we held that a State cannot refuse to entertain other evidence of intellectual disability when a defendant has an IQ score above 70. 572 U. S., at ___-___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007. Although Atkins and Hall left to the States “the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce” the restriction on executing the intellectually disabled, 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1999, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1023 (quoting Atkins, 536 U. S., at 317, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335), States’ discretion, we cautioned, is not “unfettered,” 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1998, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1023. Even if “the views of medical experts” do not “dictate” a court’s intellectual-disability determination, id., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 2000, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1025 , we clarified, the determination must be “informed by the medical community’s diagnostic framework,” id., at ___-___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 2000, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1025. We relied on the most recent (and still [***18]  current) versions of the leading diagnostic manuals—the DSM-5 and AAIDD-11. Id., at ___, ___, ___-___, ___-___, 134 S. Ct. 1986 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007.  [*1049]  Florida, we concluded, had violated the Eighth Amendment by “disregard[ing] established medical practice.” Id., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1995, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1019. We further noted that Florida had parted ways with practices and trends in other States. Id., at ___-___, 134 S. Ct. 1986 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007. Hall indicated that being informed by the medical community does not demand adherence to everything stated in the latest medical guide. But neither does our precedent license disregard of current medical standards.



III
The CCA’s conclusion that Moore’s IQ scores established that he is not intellectually disabled is irreconcilable with Hall. HN4 Hall instructs that, where an IQ score is close to, but above, 70, courts must account for the test’s “standard error of measurement.” See id., at ___-___, ___-___,134 S. Ct. 1986, 2002, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1026 . See also Brumfield v. Cain, 576 U. S. ___, ___, 135 S. Ct. 2269, 192 L. Ed. 2d 356 (2015) (relying on Hall to find unreasonable a state court’s conclusion that a score of 75 precluded an intellectual-disability finding). As we explained in Hall, the standard error of measurement is “a statistical fact, a reflection of the inherent imprecision of the test itself.” 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1995, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1019. “For purposes of most IQ tests,” this imprecision in the testing instrument “means that an individual’s score is best understood as a range of scores on [***19]  either side of the recorded score . . . within which one may say an individual’s true IQ score lies.”  [**427]  Id., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1995, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1020. A test’s standard error of measurement “reflects the reality that an individual’s intellectual functioning cannot be reduced to a single numerical score.” Ibid. See also id., at ___-___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1995, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1019; DSM-5, at 37; AAIDD, User’s Guide: Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 22-23 (11th ed. 2012) (hereinafter AAIDD-11 User’s Guide).

Moore’s score of 74, adjusted for the standard error of measurement, yields a range of 69 to 79, see 470 S. W. 3d, at 519, as the State’s retained expert acknowledged, see Brief for Petitioner 39, n. 18; App. 185, 189-190. Because the lower end of Moore’s score range falls at or below 70, the CCA had to move on to consider Moore’s adaptive functioning. See Hall, 572 U. S., at ___-___, 134 S. Ct. 1986 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007; 470 S. W. 3d, at 536 (Alcala, J., dissenting) (even if the majority correctly limited the scores it would consider, “current medical standards . . . would still require [the CCA] to examine whether [Moore] has adaptive deficits”).

Both Texas and the dissent maintain that the CCA properly considered factors unique to Moore in disregarding the lower end of the standard-error range. Post, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 439-440; Brief for Respondent 41-42; see [***20]  supra, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 423-424; 470 S. W. 3d, at 519. But the presence of other sources of imprecision in administering the test to a particular individual, see post, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 439-441, and n. 3, cannot narrow the test-specific standard-error range. 7Link to the text of the note

 [*1050]  In requiring the CCA to move on to consider Moore’s adaptive functioning in light of his IQ evidence, we do not suggest that “the Eighth Amendment turns on the slightest numerical difference in IQ score,” post, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 440-441. Hall invalidated Florida’s strict IQ cutoff because the cutoff took “an IQ score as final and conclusive evidence of a defendant’s intellectual capacity, when experts in the field would consider other evidence.” 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1995, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1019. Here, by contrast, we do not end the intellectual-disability inquiry, one way or the other, based on Moore’s IQ score. Rather, in line with Hall, we require that courts continue the inquiry and consider other evidence of intellectual disability where an individual’s IQ score, adjusted for the test’s standard error, falls within the clinically established range for intellectual-functioning deficits.



IV
The CCA’s consideration of Moore’s adaptive functioning also deviated from prevailing clinical standards  [**428]  and from the older clinical standards the court claimed to apply.



A
In [***21]  concluding that Moore did not suffer significant adaptive deficits, the CCA overemphasized Moore’s perceived adaptive strengths. The CCA recited the strengths it perceived, among them, Moore lived on the streets, mowed lawns, and played pool for money. See 470 S. W. 3d, at 522-523, 526-527. Moore’s adaptive strengths, in the CCA’s view, constituted evidence adequate to overcome the considerable objective evidence of Moore’s adaptive deficits, see supra, at ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 422; App. to Pet. for Cert. 180a-202a. See 470 S. W. 3d, at 522-524, 526-527. But the medical community focuses the adaptive-functioning inquiry on adaptive deficits. E.g., AAIDD-11, at 47 (“significant limitations in conceptual, social, or practical adaptive skills [are] not outweighed by the potential strengths in some adaptive skills”); DSM-5, at 33, 38 (inquiry should focus on “[d]eficits in adaptive functioning”; deficits in only one of the three adaptive-skills domains suffice to show adaptive deficits); see Brumfield, 576 U. S., at ___, 135 S. Ct. 2269, 2281, 192 L. Ed. 2d 356, 367 (“[I]ntellectually disabled persons may have ‘strengths in social or physical capabilities, strengths in some adaptive skill areas, or strengths in one aspect of an adaptive skill in which they otherwise show an overall limitation.’” (quoting AAMR, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports [***22]  8 (10th ed. 2002)). 8Link to the text of the note

In addition, the CCA stressed Moore’s improved behavior in prison. 470 S. W. 3d, at 522-524, 526-527. Clinicians, however, caution against reliance on adaptive strengths developed “in a controlled setting,” as a prison surely is. DSM-5, at 38 (“Adaptive functioning may be difficult to assess in a controlled setting (e.g., prisons, detention centers); if possible, corroborative information reflecting functioning outside those settings should be obtained.”); see AAIDD-11 User’s Guide 20 (counseling against reliance on “behavior in jail or prison”).



 [*1051]  B
The CCA furthermore concluded that Moore’s record of academic failure, along with the childhood abuse and suffering he endured, detracted from a determination that his intellectual and adaptive deficits were related. See 470 S. W. 3d, at 488, 526; supra, at ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 423, 424-425. Those traumatic experiences, however, count in the medical community as “risk factors” for intellectual disability. AAIDD-11, at 59-60 (emphasis added). Clinicians rely on such factors as cause to explore the prospect of intellectual disability further, not to counter the case for a disability determination. See id., at 60 (“[A]t least one or more of the risk factors [described  [**429]  in the manual] will be found in every case of” intellectual disability.). [***23] 

The CCA also departed from clinical practice by requiring Moore to show that his adaptive deficits were not related to “a personality disorder.” 470 S. W. 3d, at 488; see id., at 526 (Moore’s problems in kindergarten were “more likely cause[d]” by “emotional problems” than by intellectual disability). As mental-health professionals recognize, however, many intellectually disabled people also have other mental or physical impairments, for example, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, and autism. DSM-5, at 40 (“[c]o-occurring mental, neurodevelopmental, medical, and physical conditions are frequent in intellectual disability, with rates of some conditions (e.g., mental disorders, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy) three to four times higher than in the general population”); see AAIDD-11, at 58-63. Coexisting conditions frequently encountered in intellectually disabled individuals have been described in clinical literature as “[c]omorbidit[ies].” DSM-5, at 40. See also Brief for AAIDD et al. as Amici Curiae 20, and n. 25. The existence of a personality disorder or mental-health issue, in short, is “not evidence that a person does not also have intellectual disability.” Brief for American Psychological Association, [***24]  APA, et al. as Amici Curiae 19.

The CCA’s attachment to the seven Briseno evidentiary factors further impeded its assessment of Moore’s adaptive functioning.



1
By design and in operation, the Briseno factors “creat[e] an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed,” Hall, 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1990, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1014. After observing that persons with “mild” intellectual disability might be treated differently under clinical standards than under Texas’ capital system, the CCA defined its objective as identifying the “consensus of Texas citizens” on who “should be exempted from the death penalty.” Briseno, 135 S. W. 3d, at 6 (emphasis added). Mild levels of intellectual disability, although they may fall outside Texas citizens’ consensus, nevertheless remain intellectual disabilities, see Hall, 572 U. S., at ___-___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007; Atkins, 536 U. S., at 308, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335, and n. 3; AAIDD-11, at 153, and States may not execute anyone in “the entire category of [intellectually disabled] offenders,” Roper, 543 U. S., at 563-564, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (emphasis added); see supra, at ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 425.

Skeptical of what it viewed as “exceedingly subjective” medical and clinical standards, the CCA in Briseno advanced lay perceptions of intellectual disability. 135 S. W. 3d, at 8; see supra, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 423-424, and n. 6. Briseno asks, for example, “Did those who knew the person best during the developmental stage—his family, friends, [***25]  teachers, employers, authorities—think he  [*1052]  was mentally retarded at that time, and, if so, act in accordance with that determination?” 135 S. W. 3d, at 8. Addressing that question here, the CCA referred to Moore’s education in “normal classrooms during his school career,” his father’s reactions to his academic challenges, and his sister’s  [**430]  perceptions of Moore’s intellectual abilities. 470 S. W. 3d, at 526-527. But the medical profession has endeavored to counter lay stereotypes of the intellectually disabled. See AAIDD-11 User’s Guide 25-27; Brief for AAIDD et al. as Amici Curiae 9-14, and nn. 11-15. Those stereotypes, much more than medical and clinical appraisals, should spark skepticism. 9Link to the text of the note

The Briseno factors are an outlier, in comparison both to other States’ handling of intellectual-disability pleas and to Texas’ own practices in other contexts. See Hall, 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1996, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1021 (consensus in the States provides “objective indicia of society’s standards in the context of the Eighth Amendment” (internal quotation marks omitted)). No state legislature has approved the use of the Briseno factors or anything similar. In the 12 years since Texas adopted the factors, only one other state high court and one state intermediate appellate court have authorized [***26]  their use. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Bracey, 632 Pa. 75, ___-___, 117 A. 3d 270, 286-287 (2015); Howell v. State, 2011 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 447, 2011 WL 2420378, *18 (Tenn. Crim. App., June 14, 2011).

Indeed, Texas itself does not follow Briseno in contexts other than the death penalty. See Brief for Constitution Project as Amicus Curiae 14-17. For example, the related-ness requirement Texas defends here, see supra, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 423-424, is conspicuously absent from the standards the State uses to assess students for intellectual disabilities. See 19 Tex. Admin. Code §89.1040(c)(5) (2015). And even within Texas’ criminal-justice system, the State requires the intellectual-disability diagnoses of juveniles to be based on “the latest edition of the DSM.” 37 Tex. Admin. Code §380.8751(e)(3) (2016). Texas cannot satisfactorily explain why it applies current medical standards for diagnosing intellectual disability in other contexts, yet clings to superseded standards when an individual’s life is at stake. 10Link to the text of the note



 [*1053]  V
As noted supra, at ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 425, States have some flexibility, but not “unfettered discretion,” in  [**431]  enforcing Atkins’ holding. Hall, 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1998, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1023. “If the States were to have complete autonomy to define intellectual disability as they wished,” we have observed, “Atkins could become a nullity, and the Eighth Amendment’s protection of human dignity would not become a reality.” Id., at ___-___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1999, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1024).

The medical community’s current standards supply one constraint [***27]  on States’ leeway in this area. Reflecting improved understanding over time, see DSM-5, at 7; AAIDD-11, at xiv-xv, current manuals offer “the best available description of how mental disorders are expressed and can be recognized by trained clinicians,” DSM-5, at xli. See also Hall, 572 U. S., at ___, ___, ___, ___-___, ___-___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007 (employing current clinical standards); Atkins, 536 U. S., at 308, n. 3, 317, n. 22, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335 (relying on then-current standards).

In Moore’s case, the habeas court applied current medical standards in concluding that Moore is intellectually disabled and therefore ineligible for the death penalty. See, e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 150a-151a, 200a-203a. The CCA, however, faulted the habeas court for “disregarding [the CCA’s] case law and employing the definition of intellectual disability presently used by the AAIDD.” 470 S. W. 3d, at 486. The CCA instead fastened its intellectual-disability determination to “the AAMR’s 1992 definition of intellectual disability that [it] adopted in Briseno for Atkins claims presented in Texas death-penalty cases.” Ibid. By rejecting the habeas court’s application of medical guidance and clinging to the standard it laid out in Briseno, including the wholly nonclinical Briseno factors, the CCA failed adequately to inform itself of the “medical community’s [***28]  diagnostic framework,” Hall, 572 U. S., at ___-___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 2000, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1025. Because Briseno pervasively infected the CCA’s analysis, the decision of that court cannot stand.



***
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

The CCA is Texas’ court of last resort in criminal cases. See Tex. Const., Art. 5, §5.

Under Texas law, the CCA, not the court of first instance, is “the ultimate factfinder” in habeas corpus proceedings. Ex parte Reed, 271 S. W. 3d 698, 727 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); see Ex parte Moore, 470 S. W. 3d 481, 489 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015).

The third element is not at issue here.

The habeas court considered a seventh score (of 59 on a WAIS-IV test administered in 2013) elsewhere in its opinion, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 170a-172a, but did not include that score in the calculation of Moore’s average IQ score, see id., at 170a.

5Link to the location of the note in the document
This relatedness requirement, the CCA noted, is retained in the DSM-5. See 470 S. W. 3d, at 487, n. 5 (citing DSM-5, at 38).

The seven “Briseno factors” are:

"Did those who knew the person best during the developmental stage—his family, friends, teachers, employers, authorities—think he was mentally retarded at that time, and, if so, act in accordance with that determination?

"Has the person formulated plans and carried them through or is his conduct impulsive?

"Does his conduct show leadership or does it show that he is led around by others?

"Is his conduct in response to external stimuli rational and appropriate, regardless of whether it is socially acceptable?

"Does he respond coherently, rationally, and on point to oral or written questions or do his responses wander from subject to subject?

"Can the person hide facts or lie effectively in his own or others’ interests?

"Putting aside any heinousness or gruesomeness surrounding the capital offense, did the commission of that offense require forethought, planning, and complex execution of purpose?" Briseno, 135 S. W. 3d, at 8-9.

The dissent suggests that Hall tacitly approved Idaho’s approach to capital sentencing, which the dissent characterizes as “grant[ing] trial courts discretion to draw ‘reasonable inferences’ about IQ scores and, where appropriate, decline to consider the full range of the [standard error of measurement].” Post, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 439-440 (quoting Hall, 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007 (quoting Pizzuto v. State, 146 Idaho 720, 729, 202 P. 3d 642, 651 (2008))). We referred in Hall to Idaho’s capital-sentencing scheme, however, only to note that the State had “passed legislation allowing a defendant to present additional evidence of intellectual disability even when an IQ test score is above 70.” 572 U. S., at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1997, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 1022.

The dissent suggests that disagreement exists about the precise role of adaptive strengths in the adaptive-functioning inquiry. See post, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 437-438. But even if clinicians would consider adaptive strengths alongside adaptive weaknesses within the same adaptive-skill domain, neither Texas nor the dissent identifies any clinical authority permitting the arbitrary offsetting of deficits against unconnected strengths in which the CCA engaged, see 470 S. W. 3d, at 520-526.

9Link to the location of the note in the document
As elsewhere in its opinion, the CCA, in its deployment of the Briseno factors, placed undue emphasis on adaptive strengths, see supra, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 428; 470 S. W. 3d, at 527, and regarded risk factors for intellectual disability as evidence of the absence of intellectual disability, see supra, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 428-429; 470 S. W. 3d, at 526-527.

Given the Briseno factors’ flaws, it is unsurprising that scholars and experts have long criticized the factors. See, e.g., American Bar Assn., Evaluating Fairness and Accuracy in State Death Penalty Systems: The Texas Capital Punishment Assessment Report 395 (2013) (“The Briseno factors create an especially high risk that [an intellectually disabled defendant] will be executed because, in many ways, they contradict established methods for diagnosing [intellectual disability].”); Blume, Johnson, & Seeds, Of Atkins and Men: Deviations from Clinical Definitions of Mental Retardation in Death Penalty Cases (footnote omitted), 18 Cornell J. L. & Pub. Pol’y 689, 710-712 (2009) (“The Briseno factors present an array of divergences from the clinical definitions.”); Macvaugh & Cunningham, Atkins v. Virginia: Implications and Recommendations for Forensic Practice, 37 J. Psychiatry & L. 131, 136 (2009) (“The seven criteria of the Briseno opinion operationalize an Atkins interpretation that [exempts only] a subcategory of persons with [intellectual disabilities] from execution.”). See also 470 S. W. 3d, at 529-530, and n. 5 (Alcala, J., dissenting) (summarizing, in this case, scholarly criticism of Briseno).
