
I adhere to the view that this Court’s decision in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (per curiam), denigrates core First Amendment speech and should be overruled. See Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S. 230, 265–267, 126 S.Ct. 2479, 165 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); Federal Election Comm’n v. Beaumont, 539 U.S. 146, 164–165, 123 S.Ct. 2200, 156 L.Ed.2d 179 (2003) (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Federal Election Comm’n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U.S. 431, 465–466, 121 S.Ct. 2351, 150 L.Ed.2d 461 (2001) (Colorado II ) (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 412–420, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000) (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm’n, 518 U.S. 604, 635–640, 116 S.Ct. 2309, 135 L.Ed.2d 795 (1996) (Colorado I ) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part).
 
Political speech is “ ‘the primary object of First Amendment protection’ ” and “the lifeblood of a self-governing people.” Colorado II, supra, at 465–466, 121 S.Ct. 2351 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Contributions to political campaigns, no less than direct expenditures, “generate essential political speech” by fostering discussion of public issues and candidate qualifications. Shrink Missouri, supra, at 412, 120 S.Ct. 897 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); see also id., at 410–411, 120 S.Ct. 897. Buckley itself recognized that both contribution and expenditure limits “operate in an area of the most fundamental First Amendment activities” and “implicate fundamental First Amendment interests.” 424 U.S., at 14, 23, 96 S.Ct. 612. But instead of treating political giving and political spending alike, Buckley distinguished the two, embracing a bifurcated standard of review under which contribution limits receive less rigorous scrutiny. Id., at 25, 96 S.Ct. 612.
 
As I have explained before, “[t]he analytic foundation of Buckley ... was tenuous from the very beginning and has only continued to erode in the intervening years.” Shrink Missouri, supra, at 412, 120 S.Ct. 897 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). To justify a lesser standard of review for contribution limits, Buckley relied on the premise that contributions are different in *1463 kind from direct expenditures. None of the Court’s bases for that premise withstands careful review. The linchpin of the Court’s analysis was its assertion that “[w]hile contributions may result in political expression if spent by a candidate or an association to present views to the voters, the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor.” 424 U.S., at 21, 96 S.Ct. 612. But that “ ‘speech by proxy’ ” rationale quickly breaks down, given that “[e]ven in the case of a direct expenditure, there is usually some go-between that facilitates the dissemination of the spender’s message—for instance, an advertising agency or a television station.” Colorado I, supra, at 638–639, 121 S.Ct. 2351 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Moreover, we have since rejected the “ ‘proxy speech’ ” approach as affording insufficient First Amendment protection to “the voices of those of modest means as opposed to those sufficiently wealthy to be able to buy expensive media ads with their own resources.” Federal Election Comm’n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U.S. 480, 495, 105 S.Ct. 1459, 84 L.Ed.2d 455 (1985); see Shrink Missouri, supra, at 413–414, 120 S.Ct. 897 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).
 
The remaining justifications Buckley provided are also flawed. For example, Buckley claimed that contribution limits entail only a “marginal” speech restriction because “[a] contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views, but does not communicate the underlying basis for the support.” 424 U.S., at 20, 21, 96 S.Ct. 612. But this Court has never required a speaker to explain the reasons for his position in order to obtain full First Amendment protection. Instead, we have consistently held that speech is protected even “when the underlying basis for a position is not given.” Shrink Missouri, supra, at 415, n. 3, 120 S.Ct. 897 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); see, e.g., City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43, 46, 114 S.Ct. 2038, 129 L.Ed.2d 36 (1994) (sign reading “For Peace in the Gulf”); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 415–416, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989) (flag burning); Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 510–511, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969) (black armband signifying opposition to Vietnam War); see also Colorado I, supra, at 640, 116 S.Ct. 2309 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (“Even a pure message of support, unadorned with reasons, is valuable to the democratic process”)
 
Equally unpersuasive is Buckley’s suggestion that contribution limits warrant less stringent review because “[t]he quantity of communication by the contributor does not increase perceptibly with the size of his contribution,” and “[a]t most, the size of the contribution provides a very rough index of the intensity of the contributor’s support for the candidate.” 424 U.S., at 21, 96 S.Ct. 612. Contributions do increase the quantity of communication by “amplifying the voice of the candidate” and “help[ing] to ensure the dissemination of the messages that the contributor wishes to convey.” Shrink Missouri, supra, at 415, 120 S.Ct. 897 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). They also serve as a quantifiable metric of the intensity of a particular contributor’s support, as demonstrated by the frequent practice of giving different amounts to different candidates. Buckley simply failed to recognize that “we have accorded full First Amendment protection to expressions of intensity.” Id., at 415, n. 3, 120 S.Ct. 897; see also Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 25–26, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971) (protecting the use of an obscenity for emphasis).
 
Although today’s decision represents a faithful application of our precedents, the *1464 plurality’s discussion of Buckley omits any reference to these discarded rationales. Instead, the plurality alludes only to Buckley’s last remaining reason for devaluing political contributions relative to expenditures. See ante, at 1444 – 1445 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S., at 21, 96 S.Ct. 612). The relevant sentence from Buckley reads as follows:
“A limitation on the amount of money a person may give to a candidate or campaign organization thus involves little direct restraint on his political communication, for it permits the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution but does not in any way infringe the contributor’s freedom to discuss candidates and issues.” Ibid.
That proposition, read in full, cannot be squared with a key premise of today’s decision.
 
Among the Government’s justifications for the aggregate limits set forth in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) is that “an individual can engage in the ‘symbolic act of contributing’ to as many entities as he wishes.” Brief for Appellee 20. That is, the Government contends that aggregate limits are constitutional as long as an individual can still contribute some token amount (a dime, for example) to each of his preferred candidates. The plurality, quite correctly, rejects that argument, noting that “[i]t is no answer to say that the individual can simply contribute less money to more people.” Ante, at 1449. That is so because “[t]o require one person to contribute at lower levels than others because he wants to support more candidates or causes is to impose a special burden on broader participation in the democratic process.” Ibid.
 
What the plurality does not recognize is that the same logic also defeats the reasoning from Buckley on which the plurality purports to rely. Under the plurality’s analysis, limiting the amount of money a person may give to a candidate does impose a direct restraint on his political communication; if it did not, the aggregate limits at issue here would not create “a special burden on broader participation in the democratic process.” Ibid. I am wholly in agreement with the plurality’s conclusion on this point: “[T]he Government may not penalize an individual for ‘robustly exercis[ing]’ his First Amendment rights.” Ibid. (quoting Davis v. Federal Election Comm’n, 554 U.S. 724, 739, 128 S.Ct. 2759, 171 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008)). I regret only that the plurality does not acknowledge that today’s decision, although purporting not to overrule Buckley, continues to chip away at its footings.
 
In sum, what remains of Buckley is a rule without a rationale. Contributions and expenditures are simply “two sides of the same First Amendment coin,” and our efforts to distinguish the two have produced mere “word games” rather than any cognizable principle of constitutional law. Buckley, supra, at 241, 244, 96 S.Ct. 612 (Burger, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). For that reason, I would overrule Buckley and subject the aggregate limits in BCRA to strict scrutiny, which they would surely fail. See Colorado I, 518 U.S., at 640–641, 116 S.Ct. 2309 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (“I am convinced that under traditional strict scrutiny, broad prophylactic caps on both spending and giving in the political process ... are unconstitutional”).
 
This case represents yet another missed opportunity to right the course of our campaign finance jurisprudence by restoring a standard that is faithful to the First Amendment. Until we undertake that reexamination, we remain in a “halfway house” of our own design. Shrink Missouri, 528 U.S., at 410, 120 S.Ct. 897 *1465 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). For these reasons, I concur only in the judgment.
