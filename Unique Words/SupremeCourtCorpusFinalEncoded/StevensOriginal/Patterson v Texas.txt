TORONTO M. PATTERSON v. TEXAS; IN RE TORONTO M. PATTERSON

No. 02-6010 (02A164), No. 02-6017 (02A165)

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

536 U.S. 984

August 28, 2002, Decided

JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
Petitioner was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for a crime he committed when he was 17 years old. In his dissenting opinion in Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U.S. 361, 382, 106 L. Ed. 2d 306, 109 S. Ct. 2969 (1989), Justice Brennan, writing for four Members of the Court, explained why the Eighth Amendment prohibits the taking of the life of a person as punishment for a crime committed when below the age of 18. I joined that opinion and remain convinced that it correctly interpreted the law. Since that opinion was written, the issue has been the subject of further debate and discussion both in this country and in other civilized nations. Given the apparent [**2]  consensus that exists among the States and in the international community against the execution of a capital sentence imposed on a juvenile offender, I think it would be appropriate for the Court to revisit the issue at the earliest opportunity. I would therefore grant a stay of this execution to give the Court an opportunity to confront the question at its next scheduled conference in September. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the denial of a stay.
