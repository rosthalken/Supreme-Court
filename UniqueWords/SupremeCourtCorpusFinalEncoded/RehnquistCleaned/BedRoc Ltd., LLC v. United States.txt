    The Government is correct that the Western Nuclear Court sidestepped the impact of this line of reasoning by relying on the ambiguity of the term "minerals" and the possibility that Congress was not aware of Interior's Zimmerman decision, see 462 U.S., at 45-47, 76 L. Ed. 2d 400, 103 S. Ct. 2218. But we decline to extend that approach beyond the SRHA. In our analysis, the statutory structure of the Pittman Act convincingly reinforces the unambiguous meaning of the term "valuable minerals."
Notwithstanding the contemporaneous plain meaning of the Pittman Act's mineral reservation, the Government argues that the Act's legislative history counsels us to give "valuable minerals" precisely the same meaning we ascribed to "minerals" in Western Nuclear. Because we have held that the text of the statutory reservation clearly excludes sand and gravel, we have no occasion to resort to legislative history. See, e.g., Lamie, 540 U.S., at ___, ___, 157 L. Ed. 2d at 1033, 1036-1037; Hartford Underwriters, 530 U.S., at 6, 147 L. Ed. 2d 1, 120 S. Ct. 1942; Hughes Aircraft Co., 525 U.S., at 438, 142 L. Ed. 2d 881, 119 S. Ct. 755; Connecticut Nat. Bank, 503 U.S., at 254, 117 L. Ed. 2d 391, 112 S. Ct. 1146.  Having declined to extend Western Nuclear's rationale to a statute    where the plain meaning will not support it, we will not allow it in through the back door by presuming that "the legislature was ignorant of the meaning of the language     it employed." Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U.S. 147, 152, 27 L. Ed. 431, 2 S. Ct. 391 (1883).  
    The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is    therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
It is so ordered.  

1. The population of Nevada in 1910 was only 81,875; by 1920, it had fallen to 77,407. Less than 11% of Nevada's 112,000 square miles of land was privately owned. H. R. Rep. No. 286, at 2.
2. "Nonmineral" lands are "more valuable for agricultural or other purposes than for the minerals [they] contai[n]." Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc., 462 U.S. 36, 48, n. 9, 76 L. Ed. 2d 400, 103 S. Ct. 2218 (1983).
3. In 1996, BedRoc conveyed 40 of its 560 acres to petitioner Western Elite, Inc.
4. Four Justices vigorously disagreed with the Court's approach. 462 U.S. at 60-72, 76 L. Ed. 2d 400, 103 S. Ct. 2218 (Powell, J., joined by Rehnquist, Stevens, and O'Connor, JJ., dissenting). The dissenters pointed out that at the time the SRHA was enacted the Department of the Interior "had ruled consistently that gravel was not a mineral under the general mining laws." 462 U.S. at 62-67, 76 L. Ed. 2d 400, 103 S. Ct. 2218. Furthermore, the ultimate congressional purpose behind the SRHA was settling the West, not stockraising, the dissenters argued, and this purpose would have been thwarted if potential settlers thought the Government had reserved "commonplace substances that actually constitute much of the soil." 462 U.S. at 71-72, 76 L. Ed. 2d 400, 103 S. Ct. 2218.
5. Despite the textual difference, Justice Stevens nonetheless finds Western Nuclear dispositive because, according to him, "the Court's interpretation of the term 'mineral' in the SRHA included the requirement that the material be valuable." Post, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 350. That is not quite correct. Western Nuclear defined "minerals," in part, as substances "that can be used for commercial purposes" and that "have separate value" from the soil. 462 U.S., at 53-54, 76 L. Ed. 2d 400, 103 S. Ct. 2218. However, as the remainder of our opinion explains, the minimal inquiry into whether a substance might at some point have separate value from the soil and might, in the abstract, be susceptible of commercial use is a far different inquiry from whether the substance is a "valuable mineral" as Congress used the term in 1919.
6. Indeed, as petitioners aptly point out, "[e]ven the most enterprising settler could not have sold sand in the desert." Brief for Petitioners 6.
7. Congress restored the Zimmerman rule in 1955 when it enacted the Surface Resources Act, § 3, 69 Stat 368, 30 USC § 611 [30 USCS § 611] ("No deposit of common varieties of sand [and] gravel . . . shall be deemed a valuable mineral deposit within the meaning of the mining laws of the United States . . .").
8. While Justice Stevens does not contest the plain meaning of the Pittman Act's mineral reservation, he nonetheless takes us to task for "refusing to examine" the legislative history proffered by the Government and thereby engaging in a "deliberately uninformed" and "unconstrained" method of statutory interpretation. Post, at ____ - ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 350-351. Of course, accepting Justice Stevens' approach would require a radical abandonment of our longstanding precedents that permit resort to legislative history only when necessary to interpret ambiguous statutory text. Chief Justice Marshall in 1805 stated the principle that definitively resolves this case nearly 200 years later: HN4 "Where a law is plain and unambiguous, whether it be expressed in general or limited terms, the legislature should be intended to mean what they have plainly expressed, and consequently no room is left for construction." United States v. Fisher, 6 U.S. 358, 2 Cranch 358, 399, 2 L. Ed. 304. We thus cannot accept Justice Stevens' invitation to presume that Congress expressed itself in a single House Committee Report rather than in the unambiguous statutory text approved by both Houses and signed by the President. We fail to see, moreover, how a court exercises unconstrained discretion when it carries out its "sole function" with respect to an unambiguous statute, namely, to "enforce it according to its terms." Caminetti v. United States, 242 U.S. 470, 485, 61 L. Ed. 442, 37 S. Ct. 192 (1917).
