Albert Gibson, Petitioner v. Louisiana.

No. 14-9998.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

136 S. Ct. 1360

March 7, 2016, Decided

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins, concurring in the decision to grant, vacate, and remand in these cases: The Court has held the petitions in these and many other cases pending the decision in Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. ___, 136 S. Ct. 718, 193 L. Ed. 2d 599 (2016). In holding these petitions and now vacating and remanding the judgments below, the Court has not assessed whether petitioners’ asserted entitlement to retroactive relief “is properly presented in the case.” Id., at ___, 136 S. Ct. 718, 732, 193 L. Ed. 2d 599, 617. On remand, courts should understand that the Court’s disposition of these petitions does not reflect any view regarding petitioners’ entitlement to relief. The Court’s disposition does not, for example, address whether an adequate and independent state ground bars relief, whether petitioners forfeited or waived any entitlement to relief (by, for example, entering into a plea agreement waiving any entitlement to relief), or whether petitioners’ sentences actually [*2]  qualify as mandatory life without parole sentences.
