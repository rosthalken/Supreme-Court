
For the reasons given by CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, ante, at 871-873, I agree that "constructive knowledge" cannot be the basis for a violation of 28 U.S. C. § 455(a). The question then remains whether respondent is entitled to a new trial because there are other "extraordinary circumstances,"     apart from the § 455(a) violation found by the Fifth Circuit, that justify "relief from the operation of the judgment." See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(6); Ackermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 199, 95 L. Ed. 207, 71 S. Ct. 209 (1950); Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, 613, 93 L. Ed. 266, 69 S. Ct. 384 (1949). Although the Court collects an impressive array of arguments that might support the granting of such relief, I believe the issue should be addressed in the first instance by the courts below. I would therefore remand this case with appropriate instructions.
