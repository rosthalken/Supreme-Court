IN RE PHILIP RAY WORKMAN

00-9199 (00A850)

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

532 U.S. 954

March 29, 2001, Decided

[*954]  Statement of JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER and JUSTICE BREYER join, respecting the denial of the petition for writ of habeas corpus.
As Judge Merritt pointed out in his opinion dissenting from the Court of Appeals' denial of relief last January, see Workman v. Bell. 227 F.3d 331, 332 (2001), this petitioner has raised serious questions concerning his eligibility for the death penalty. When this Court reviewed petitioner's applications for relief in February, I was persuaded that those claims were sufficiently serious to require a full evidentiary hearing before a factfinder. The majority of the Court, however, did not share that opinion. I remain of the view that [**2]  such  [*955]  a hearing should be held, but acknowledge that the issue is effectively foreclosed by the action that the Court took in February.
