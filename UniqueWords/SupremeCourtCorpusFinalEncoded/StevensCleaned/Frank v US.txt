Lyles v. United States, 103 U.S. AD. C. 22, 25, 254 F. 2d 725, 728 (1957) (en banc) (opinion of Burger and Prettyman, JJ.) ("We think the jury has a right to know the meaning of this possible verdict as accurately as it knows by common knowledge the meaning of the other two possible verdicts"), cert. denied, 356 U.S. 961 (1958). Judges Burger and Prettyman found historical support in Hadfield's Case, 27 How. St. Tr. 1282, 1354-1355 (K.B. 1800), where the Lord Chief Justice instructed the jury that a defendant found not guilty by reason of insanity would be confined. Lyles, 103 U.S. AD. C., at 26, n. 3, 254 F.2d, at 729, n. 3.

    Because the denial of a writ of certiorari is not a ruling on the merits, the Court's action today is not inconsistent with that conclusion. 4 Rather, the Court's action is supported by    the fact that a square conflict between two Courts of Appeals has not arisen since the enactment of the 1984 statute,     and by the Court's normal practice of awaiting such a conflict before considering the significance of new federal legislation.
