Supreme Court of the United States
TUAN ANH NGUYEN and Joseph Boulais, Petitioners,
v.
IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE.
No. 99–2071.
|
Argued Jan. 9, 2001.
|
Decided June 11, 2001.
Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, concurring.

I remain of the view that the Court lacks power to provide relief of the sort requested in this suit—namely, conferral of citizenship on a basis other than that prescribed by Congress. See Miller v. Albright, 523 U.S. 420, 452, 118 S.Ct. 1428, 140 L.Ed.2d 575 (1998) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). A majority of the Justices in Miller having concluded otherwise, see id., at 423, 118 S.Ct. 1428 (opinion of STEVENS, J., joined by REHNQUIST, C.J.); id., at 460, 118 S.Ct. 1428 (GINSBURG, J., joined by SOUTER and BREYER, JJ., dissenting); id., at 471, 118 S.Ct. 1428 (BREYER, J., joined by SOUTER and *74 GINSBURG, JJ., dissenting); and a majority of the Court today proceeding on the same assumption; I think it appropriate for me to reach the merits of petitioners’ equal protection claims. I join the opinion of the Court.
