MacDONALD, SOMMER & FRATES, Appellant
v.
YOLO COUNTY et al.
No. 84-2015.

Argued March 26, 1986.
|
Decided June 25, 1986.
|
Rehearing Denied Sept. 3, 1986.

See 478 U.S. 1035, 107 S.Ct. 22.
 

Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Justice POWELL joins, dissenting.
I agree with Justice WHITE that the Court of Appeal’s opinion is best read as rejecting appellant’s allegations as a matter of substantive takings law; that appellant sufficiently alleged a final decision denying it all beneficial use of its property; that a land use regulation restricting the use of property may amount to a taking; and that the allegations here are sufficient to state a takings claim. Accordingly, I join Parts I, II, and III of his dissenting opinion. As Justice WHITE recognizes in Part IV of his opinion, the questions surrounding what compensation, if any, is due a property owner in the context of “interim” takings are multifaceted and difficult. I would not reach these questions without first permitting the courts below to address them in light of the fact that appellant has sufficiently alleged a taking.
