Justice O'Connor, concurring.

I join the opinion of the court, and I agree that the State's failure to properly raise its challenge to our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence supports a decision not to pass on the merits of this [****23]  claim. Ante, at 10.  [**1187]  I further note, however, that the State does nothing that would persuade me to reconsider or abandon our well-established body of negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence.
