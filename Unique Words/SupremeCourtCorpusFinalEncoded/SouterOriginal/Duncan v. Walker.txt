GEORGE DUNCAN, SUPERINTENDENT, GREAT MEADOW CORRECTIONAL FACILITY v. SHERMAN WALKER

No. 00-121

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

121 S. Ct. 2120

March 26, 2001, Argued 
June 18, 2001, Decided

JUSTICE SOUTER, concurring.
Although I join the Court's opinion in full, I have joined JUSTICE STEVENS's separate opinion pointing out that nothing bars a district court from retaining jurisdiction pending complete exhaustion of state remedies, and that a claim for equitable tolling could present a serious issue on facts different from those before us.
