TERRY STEWART, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL. v. WALTER LAGRAND

No. A-735 (98-1412)

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

526 U.S. 115

March 3, 1999, Decided

JUSTICE STEVENS dissents.
In my opinion the answer to the question whether a capital defendant may consent to be executed by an unacceptably torturous method of execution is by no means clear. I would not decide such an important question without full briefing and argument.
I, therefore, respectfully dissent.
