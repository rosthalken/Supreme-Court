
What legitimate purpose does it serve to hold any human being in solitary confinement for 40 years awaiting execution? What does this case tell us about a capital punishment system that, in my view, works in random, virtually arbitrary ways? I have previously explored these matters more systematically, coming to the conclusion that this Court should hear argument as to whether capital punishment as currently practiced is consistent with the Constitution’s prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishment.” Amdt. 8. See Glossip v. Gross, 576 U. S. ___, ___, 135 S. Ct. 2726, 192 L. Ed. 2d 761 (2015) (Breyer, J., dissenting). The facts and circumstances of Smith’s case reinforce that conclusion.

I recognize the procedural obstacles that make it difficult for this Court now to grant certiorari in this particular case. See 28 U. S. C. §2254. Those problems would not have prevented the Court from granting certiorari 10 years ago when Smith asked us to do so (after spending 30 years on death row). See Smith v. Arizona,     552 U. S. 985, 128 S. Ct. 466, 169 L. Ed. 2d 326 (2007) (Breyer, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). Regardless, Smith’s confinement reinforces the need for this Court, or other courts, to consider in an appropriate case the underlying constitutional question.
