AT&T CORPORATION, Petitioner v. NOREEN HULTEEN et al.

No. 07-543

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

129 S. Ct. 1962

December 10, 2008, Argued 
May 18, 2009, Decided

Justice Stevens, concurring.
Today my appraisal of the Court's decision in General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 97 S. Ct. 401, 50 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1976), is the same as that expressed more than 30 years ago in my dissent. I therefore agree with much of what Justice Ginsburg has to say  [*717]  in this case. Nevertheless, I must  [***912] accept Gilbert's interpretation of Title VII as having been the governing law until Congress enacted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Because this case involves rules that were in force only prior to that Act, I join the Court's opinion.
