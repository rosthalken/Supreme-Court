JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.

 [***95]  The legislative history of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947, discussed in Part I-B of JUSTICE BLACKMUN's dissenting opinion, coupled with the plain language in the proviso to § 8(b)(1)(A), persuades me that the "right to refrain" protected by § 7 of [****67]  the Act does not encompass the "right to resign." Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
