
For reasons explained in my dissenting opinion in University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U. S. ___, ___ 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013), I do not read “because of” in the context of antidiscrimination    laws to mean “solely because of.” See id., at ___-___, ___-___, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503, 509-516, 525-539. And I do not agree that words “appear[ing] in two or more legal rules, and so in connection with more than one purpose, ha[ve] and should have precisely the same scope in all of them.” Cook, “Substance” and “Procedure” in the Conflict of Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333, 337 (1933). But I do agree that “in the interpretation of a criminal statute subject to the rule of lenity,” where there is room for debate, one should not choose the construction “that disfavors the defendant.” Ante, at 187 L.Ed. 2d at 726. Accordingly, I join the Court’s judgment.
