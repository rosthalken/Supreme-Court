SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

529 U.S. 848

March 21, 2000, Argued 
May 22, 2000, Decided

JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins, concurring.
In joining the Court's opinion, I express no view on the question whether the federal arson statute, 18 U.S.C. § 844(i) (1994 ed., Supp. IV), as there construed, is constitutional in its application to all buildings used for commercial activities.
