Supreme Court of the United States
Carl S. DELLMUTH, Acting Secretary of Education of Pennsylvania, Petitioner
v.
Russell A. MUTH, Jr., et al.
No. 87–1855.
|
Argued Feb. 28, 1989.
|
Decided June 15, 1989.

*233 Justice SCALIA, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court, with the understanding that its reasoning does not preclude congressional elimination of sovereign immunity in statutory text that clearly subjects States to suit for monetary damages, though without explicit reference to state sovereign immunity or the Eleventh Amendment.
