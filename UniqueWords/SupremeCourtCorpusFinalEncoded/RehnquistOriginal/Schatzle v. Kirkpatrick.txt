1982 U.S. LEXIS 2044
SCHATZLE v. KIRKPATRICK, SECRETARY OF STATE OF MISSOURI, ET AL.
Supreme Court of the United States
May 17, 1982
No. 81-1731.


JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concurring.
Appellant in this case requests that we overrule Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.S. 526 (1969). But here the District Court did not invalidate a reapportionment plan duly adopted by the state legislature; it merely adopted a plan of its own when the legislature was unable to reach agreement. This case, therefore, does not require that we address appellant's suggestion respecting Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, supra.
