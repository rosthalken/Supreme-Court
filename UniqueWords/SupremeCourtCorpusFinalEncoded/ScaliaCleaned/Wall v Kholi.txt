
*561 The Court holds that the term “collateral review” in 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) means review that is not direct, ante, at 1284, and that a motion under Rhode Island’s Rule 35 seeks collateral review, ante, at 1286. Because I agree with those conclusions, I cannot join footnote 3 of the Court’s opinion, ante, at 1286, n. 3, which declines to decide whether a Rule 35 motion seeks direct review.
