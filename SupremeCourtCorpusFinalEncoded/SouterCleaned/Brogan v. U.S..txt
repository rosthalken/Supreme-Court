I join the opinion of the Court except for its response to petitioner's argument premised on the potential for prosecutorial abuse of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 as now written (ante, 7-8). On that point I have joined JUSTICE GINSBURG's opinion espousing congressional attention to the risks inherent in the statute's current breadth.
