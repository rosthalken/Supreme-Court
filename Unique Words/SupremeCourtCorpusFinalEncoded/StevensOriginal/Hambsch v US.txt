HAMBSCH v. UNITED STATES

No. 88-6120

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

490 U.S. 1054

May 1, 1989

MEMORANDUM OF JUSTICE STEVENS respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari.
There are times when it is important to emphasize the fact that an order denying a petition for a writ of certiorari is not a ruling on the merits of any question presented by the petition. See Singleton v. Commissioner, 439 U.S. 940, 942 (1978) (STEVENS, J., respecting denial of petition for writ of certiorari). In my opinion, this is such an occasion.
