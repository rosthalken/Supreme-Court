Supreme Court of the United States
EASTERN ENTERPRISES, Petitioner,
v.
Kenneth S. APFEL, Commissioner of Social Security, et al.
No. 97–42.
|
Argued March 4, 1998.

Decided June 25, 1998.
**2154 Justice THOMAS, concurring.

Justice O’CONNOR’S opinion correctly concludes that the Coal Act’s imposition of retroactive liability on petitioner violates the Takings Clause. I write separately to emphasize that the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, § 9, cl. 3, even more clearly reflects the principle that “[r]etrospective laws are, indeed, generally unjust.” 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution § 1398, p. 272 (5th ed. 1891). Since Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798), however, this Court has considered the Ex Post Facto Clause to apply only in the criminal context. I have never been convinced of the soundness of this limitation, which in Calder was *539 principally justified because a contrary interpretation would render the Takings Clause unnecessary. See id., 3 U.S., at 394 (opinion of Chase, J.). In an appropriate case, therefore, I would be willing to reconsider Calder and its progeny to determine whether a retroactive civil law that passes muster under our current Takings Clause jurisprudence is nonetheless unconstitutional under the Ex Post Facto Clause. Today’s case, however, does present an unconstitutional taking, and I join Justice O’CONNOR’s well-reasoned opinion in full.
