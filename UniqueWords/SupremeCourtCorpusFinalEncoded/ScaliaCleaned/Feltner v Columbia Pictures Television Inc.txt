
It is often enough that we must hold an enactment of Congress to be unconstitutional. I see no reason to do so here—not *356 because I believe that jury trial is not constitutionally required (I do not reach that issue), but because the statute can and therefore should be read to provide jury trial.
 
“[W]here a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter.” United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366, 408, 29 S.Ct. 527, 536, 53 L.Ed. 836 (1909). The Copyright Act of 1976 authorizes statutory damages for copyright infringement “in a sum of not less than $500 or more than $20,000 as the court considers just.” 17 U.S.C. § 504(c). The Court concludes that it is not “fairly possible,” ante, at 1283 (internal quotation marks omitted), to read § 504(c) as authorizing jury determination of the amount of those damages. I disagree.
 
In common legal parlance, the word “court” can mean “[t]he judge or judges, as distinguished from the counsel or jury.” Webster’s New International Dictionary 611 (2d ed.1949) (def. 10d). But it also has a broader meaning, which includes both judge and jury. See, e.g., ibid. (def. 10b: “The persons duly assembled under authority of law for the administration of justice”); Black’s Law Dictionary 318 (5th ed.1979) (“... A body organized to administer justice, and including both judge and jury”). We held in Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978), that a statute authorizing “the court ... to grant such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate,” 29 U.S.C. § 626(b), could fairly be read to afford a right to jury trial on claims for backpay under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.
 
As the Court correctly observes, ante, at 1284, there was more evidence in Lorillard than there is in the present case that “court” **1289 was being used to include the jury. The remedial provision at issue explicitly referred to the “ ‘powers, remedies, and procedures ’ ” of the Fair Labor Standards Act, under which “it was well established that there was a right to a jury trial,” Lorillard, 434 U.S., at 580, 98 S.Ct., at 870. The provision’s *357 reference to “legal ... relief” also strongly suggested a statutory right to jury trial. Id., at 583, 98 S.Ct., at 871–872. The text of § 504(c) lacks such clear indications that “court” is being used in its broader sense. But their absence hardly demonstrates that the broader reading is not “fairly possible,” e.g., Tull v. United States, 481 U.S. 412, 417, n. 3, 107 S.Ct. 1831, 1835, n. 3, 95 L.Ed.2d 365 (1987). The only significant evidence cited by the Court for that proposition is that the “Copyright Act use[s] the term ‘court’ in contexts generally thought to confer authority on a judge, rather than a jury,” ante, at 1283, but “does not use the term ‘court’ in the subsection addressing awards of actual damages and profits, see § 504(b), which generally are thought to constitute legal relief,” ante, at 1284. That is a fair observation, but it is not, in my view, probative enough to compel an interpretation that is constitutionally doubtful.
 
That is at least so in light of contradictory evidence from the statutory history, which the Court chooses to ignore. Section 504(c) is the direct descendant of a remedy created for unauthorized performance of dramatic compositions in an 1856 copyright statute. That statute provided for damages “not less than one hundred dollars for the first, and fifty dollars for every subsequent performance, as to the court having cognizance thereof shall appear to be just,” enforced through an “action on the case or other equivalent remedy.” Act of Aug. 18, 1856, ch. 169, 11 Stat. 138, 139. Because actions on the case were historically tried at law, it seems clear that this original statute permitted juries to assess such damages. See Lorillard, supra, at 583, 98 S.Ct., at 871–872. Although subsequent revisions omitted the reference to “action[s] on the case,” they carried forward the language specifying damages “as to the court shall appear to be just.” See Act of July 8, 1870, ch. 230, § 101, 16 Stat. 214; Act of Jan. 6, 1897, ch. 4, 29 Stat. 482. In 1909, Congress extended those provisions to permit all copyright owners to recover “in lieu of actual damages and profits such damages as to the court shall appear just....” Act of Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 320, § 25(b), *358 35 Stat. 1081. We have recognized that, although the prior statutory damages provisions
“were broadened [in 1909] so as to include other copyrights and the limitations were changed in amount, ... the principle on which they proceeded—that of committing the amount of damages to be recovered to the court’s discretion and sense of justice, subject to prescribed limitations—was retained. The new provision, like one of the old, says the damages shall be such ‘as to the court shall appear to be just.’ ” L.A. Westermann Co. v. Dispatch Printing Co., 249 U.S. 100, 107, 39 S.Ct. 194, 196, 63 L.Ed. 499 (1919).
If a right to jury trial was consistent with the meaning of the phrase “as to the court ... shall appear to be just” in the 1856 statutory damages provision, I see no reason to insist that the phrase “as the court considers just” has a different meaning in that provision’s latest reenactment. “[W]here, as here, Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law, Congress normally can be presumed to have had knowledge of the interpretation given to the incorporated law, at least insofar as it affects the new statute.” Lorillard, supra, at 581, 98 S.Ct., at 870.
 
I do not contend that reading “court” to include “jury” is necessarily the best interpretation of this statutory text. The Court is perhaps correct that the indications pointing to a change in meaning from the 1856 statute predominate. As I have written elsewhere, however:
“The doctrine of constitutional doubt does not require that the problem-avoiding construction be the preferable one—the one the Court would adopt in any event. Such a standard would deprive the doctrine of all function. ‘Adopt the interpretation that avoids the constitutional doubt if that is the right one’ produces precisely the same result as ‘adopt the right interpretation.’ Rather, the doctrine of constitutional doubt **1290 comes into play when the statute is ‘susceptible of’ the problem-avoidinginterpretation, *359 Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U.S., at 408, 29 S.Ct., at 536—when that interpretation is reasonable, though not necessarily the best.” Almendarez–Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 270, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1243–1244, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (dissenting opinion).
As the majority’s discussion amply demonstrates, there would be considerable doubt about the constitutionality of § 504(c) if it did not permit jury determination of the amount of statutory damages. Because an interpretation of § 504(c) that avoids the Seventh Amendment question is at least “fairly possible,” I would adopt that interpretation, prevent the invalidation of this statute, and reserve the constitutional issue for another day.

During the course of the litigation, Columbia dropped all claims against all parties except its copyright claims against Feltner.
2
The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded (for further explanation) the District Court's award of costs and attorney's fees to Columbia. See 106 F.3d, at 296.

Under the 1909 Act, a copyright plaintiff could recover, “in lieu of actual damages and profits, such damages as to the court shall appear to be just, and in assessing such damages the court may, in its discretion, allow the amounts as hereinafter stated, but in the case of a newspaper reproduction of a copyrighted photograph[,] such damages shall not exceed the sum of [$200] nor be less than the sum of [$50], and such damages shall in no other case exceed the sum of [$5,000] nor be less than the sum of [$250] ...” Act of Mar. 4, 1909, § 25(b), 35 Stat. 1081 (later amended and codified at 17 U.S.C. § 101(b)).

The Courts of Appeals have unanimously held that § 504(c) is not susceptible of an interpretation that would avoid the Seventh Amendment question. See, e.g., Cass County Music Co. v. C.H.L. R., Inc., 88 F.3d 635, 641 (C.A.8 1996); Video Views, Inc. v. Studio 21, Ltd., 925 F.2d 1010, 1014 (C.A.7 1991); Gnossos Music v. Mitken Inc., 653 F.2d 117, 119 (C.A.4 1981); see also Oboler v. Goldin, 714 F.2d 211, 213 (C.A.2 1983); 4 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 14.04[C] (1997).
5
In addition, a copyright plaintiff may elect statutory damages “at any time before final judgment is rendered.” § 504(c)(1). The parties agree, and we have found no indication to the contrary, that election may occur even after a jury has returned a verdict on liability and an award of actual damages. It is at least unlikely that Congress intended that a jury, having already made a determination of actual damages, should be reconvened to make a determination of statutory damages.

The Copyright Act of 1790 did not provide for equitable remedies at all, and in Stevens v. Gladding, 17 How. 447, 15 L.Ed. 155 (1855), we held that, even after Congress had provided for equity jurisdiction under the Copyright Act, see Act of Feb. 15, 1819, ch. 19, 3 Stat. 481, the statute's damages provision could not be enforced through a suit in equity. 17 How., at 455; see also Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U.S. 617, 663, 9 S.Ct. 177, 190, 32 L.Ed. 547 (1888) (Stevens v. Gladding determined that “the penalties given by § 7 of the copyright act of 1831 cannot be enforced in a suit in equity”).

Section 1319(d) of the Clean Water Act provided that violators of certain sections of the Act “shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 per day” during the period of the violation. 481 U.S., at 414, 107 S.Ct., at 1833–1834.

This portion of our opinion was arguably dicta, for our holding that there was a right to a jury trial on issues relating to liability required us to reverse the lower court's liability determination.

It should be noted that Tull is at least in tension with Bank of Hamilton v. Lessee of Dudley, 2 Pet. 492, 7 L.Ed. 496 (1829), in which the Court held in light of the Seventh Amendment that a jury must determine the amount of compensation for improvements to real estate, and with Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 55 S.Ct. 296, 79 L.Ed. 603 (1935), in which the Court held that the Seventh Amendment bars the use of additur.
10
As we have noted, even under the Statute of Anne and the Copyright Act of 1790, the amount awarded to the Government (“one Moiety”) was determined by a jury.
