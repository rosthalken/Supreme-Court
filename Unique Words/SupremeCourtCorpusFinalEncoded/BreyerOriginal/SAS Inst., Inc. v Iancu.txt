Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor join, and with whom Justice Kagan joins except as to Part III-A, dissenting.

This case requires us to engage in a typical judicial exercise, construing a statute that is technical, unclear, and constitutes a minor procedural part of a larger administrative scheme. I would follow an interpretive technique that judges often use in such cases. Initially, using “traditional tools of statutory construction,” INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 446, 107 S. Ct. 1207, 94 L. Ed. 2d 434 (1987), [*709]  I would look to see whether the relevant statutory phrase is ambiguous or leaves a gap that Congress implicitly delegated authority to the agency to fill. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-843, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984).  [***1314]  If so, I would look to see whether the agency’s interpretation is reasonable. Id., at 843, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694. Because I believe there [**26]  is such a gap and because the Patent Office’s interpretation of the ambiguous phrase is reasonable, I would conclude that the Patent Office’s interpretation is lawful.



I
The majority sets out the statutory framework that establishes “inter partes review.” See ante, at 2-3; 35 U. S. C. §§311-319. An example will help the reader keep that framework in mind. Suppose the Patent Office issues a patent containing, say, 16 different claims. A challenger, believing the patent is invalid, seeks to invoke the inter partes review procedure.

The statutory chapter entitled “Inter partes review” explains just how this is to be done. See §§311-319. First, the challenger files a petition requesting “cancel[lation]” of one or more of the patent claims as “unpatentable” because “prior art” shows, for example, that they are not “novel.” §311(b); see §§102, 103. That petition must detail the grounds for the challenge and the supporting evidence, along with providing certain technical information. §312. Second, the patent owner may file a “preliminary response” to the petition. §313.

Third, the Director of the Patent Office will decide whether to “institute” inter partes review. §314. The statute specifies that the Director “may not authorize an inter partes review to be instituted [**27]  unless the Director determines . . . that there is a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner would prevail with respect to at least 1 of the claims challenged in the petition.” §314(a). Thus, in my example, if the Director determines that none of the 16 challenges in the petition has likely merit, he cannot institute an inter partes review. Even if there is one potentially meritorious challenge, we have said that the statute contains “no mandate to institute review,” so the Director still has discretion to deny a petition. Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee, 579 U. S. ___, ___, 136 S. Ct. 2131, 195 L. Ed. 2d 423, 437 (2016). We have also held that the Director’s decision whether to institute review is normally not reviewable. Id., at ___-___, 136 S. Ct. 2131, 195 L. Ed. 2d 423, 437.

The Director, by regulation, has delegated the power to institute review to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. 37 CFR §42.4(a) (2017). And the Director has further provided by regulation that where a petition challenges several patent claims (say, all 16 claims in my example), “the Board may authorize the review to proceed on all or some of the challenged claims.” §42.108(a) (emphasis added). Thus, where some, but not all, of the challenges have likely merit (say, 1 of the 16 has likely merit and the others are close to frivolous), the Board is free to conduct inter partes review only [**28]  as to the challenge with likely merit.

Fourth, the statute next describes the relation of a petition for review and an instituted review to other proceedings  [*710]  involving the challenged patent. §315. Fifth, the statute describes what happens once the Board begins its inter partes review, including how the Board is to take evidence and make its decisions, §316, and the nature and effect of settlements, §317.

Sixth, the statute sets forth the section primarily at issue here, which describes what happens at the end of the process. It says:

“Final Written Decision. If an inter partes review is instituted and not dismissed under this chapter, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board shall issue a final written decision with respect to the patentability of any patent claim challenged by the petitioner and any new claim added under section 316(d).” §318(a) (emphasis added).

Finally, the chapter says that a “party dissatisfied with the final written decision . . . may appeal the decision” to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. §319; see §141(c).

Thus, going through this process, if a petitioner files a petition challenging 16 claims and the Board finds that the challenges to 15 of the claims are frivolous, the Board may then, as it [**29]  interprets the statute, begin and proceed through the inter partes review process as to the remaining claim, number 16, but not in respect to the other 15 claims. Eventually the Board will produce a “final written decision” as to the patentability of claim number 16, which decision the challenger (or the patentee) can appeal to the Federal Circuit.



II
Now let us return to the question at hand, the meaning of the phrase “any patent claim challenged by the petitioner” in §318(a). Do those words unambiguously refer, as the majority believes, to “any patent claim challenged by the petitioner” in the petitioner’s original petition? The words “in the petitioner’s original petition” do not appear in the statute. And the words that do appear, “any patent claim challenged by the petitioner,” could be modified by using different words that similarly do not appear, for example, the words “in the inter partes review proceeding.” But without added words, the phrase  [***1315]  “challenged by the petitioner” does not tell us whether the relevant challenge is one made in the initial petition or only one made in the inter partes review proceeding itself. And, linguistically speaking, there is as much reason to fill that [**30]  gap with reference to the claims still being challenged in the proceeding itself as there is to fill it with reference to claims that were initially challenged in the petition but which the Board weeded out before the inter partes review proceeding began.

Which reading we give the statute makes a difference. The first reading, the majority’s reading, means that in my example, the Board must consider and write a final, and appealable, see §319, decision in respect to the challenges to all 16 claims, including the 15 frivolous challenges. The second reading requires the Board to write a final, appealable decision only in respect to the challenge to the claim (number 16 in my example) that survived the Board’s initial screening, namely, in my example, the one challenge in respect to which the Board found a “reason-able likelihood that the petitioner would prevail.” §314(a).

 [*711]  I cannot find much in the statutory context to support the majority’s claim that the statutory words “claim challenged by the petitioner” refer unambiguously to claims challenged initially in the petition. After all, the majority agrees that they do not refer to claims that initially were challenged in the petition but were later [**31]  settled or withdrawn. Ante, at 9-10; see §316(d)(1)(A) (allowing the patent owner to cancel a challenged patent claim during inter partes review); §317 (addressing settlement). The majority says that weeded-out challenges, unlike settled matters or canceled claims, involve claims that are still being “challenged ‘by the petitioner’ at the litigation’s end.” Ante, at 9-10. But weeded-out challenges are the same as settled matters and canceled claims in this respect. The petitioner cannot continue to challenge a claim once that challenge is weeded out by the Board at the institution phase. He cannot pursue it before the Board in the inter partes review, and normally he cannot pursue it in a court of appeals. See Cuozzo, 579 U. S., at ___-___, 136 S. Ct. 2131, 195 L. Ed. 2d 423 (slip op., at 11-12). The petitioner might bring a totally separate case in court in which he challenges the claim, but that is a different matter that is not the subject of this statutory chapter.

Nor does the chapter’s structure help fill the statutory gap. I concede that if we examine the “final written decision” section, §318(a), just after reading the three initial sections of the statute, §§311, 312, and 313, we may be tempted to believe that the words “any patent claim challenged” in §318(a) must refer to the claims challenged in [**32]  the petition, just as the words “each claim challenged” in §312(a)(3) unmistakably do. But once we look at the whole statute, this temptation disappears. The first section, §311, describing the inter partes review process, does not use the word “challenge.” The next section, §312, describes the requirements for the initial petition, which is filed before any inter partes proceeding has been instituted. It is about the petition, so it is not surprising that it refers to the claims challenged in the petition. The next section, §313, concerns the preliminary response, which is similarly filed before the inter partes review proceeding has been instituted and is thus similarly focused on the petition, although it does not use the word “challenged.”

The very next section, however, §314, along with part of §315, describes preliminary screening and the institution of the inter partes review proceeding. The remainder of §315, and the following sections, §§316 and 317, then describe how that proceeding, once instituted, will be conducted (and provide for settlements). Only then does §318 appear. That statutory provision tells the Board that, at the conclusion of the inter partes review proceeding, it must “issue a final written decision [**33]  with respect to the patentability of any patent claim challenged by the petitioner.” §318(a). And in this context, a context about the inter partes review proceeding itself, it is more than reasonable to think that the phrase “patent claim challenged by the petitioner” refers to challenges made in the proceeding, not challenges made in the petition but never made a part of the proceeding.

I am not helped by examining, as the majority examines, what Congress  [*712]  might have done had it used other language. Ante, at 6-8. The majority points out that had Congress meant anything other than “challenged in the petition,” it might have said so more clearly. Ibid. But similarly, if Congress had meant “challenged in the petition,” it might have used the words “in the petition.” After all, it used those very words only four sections earlier. See §314(a) (referring to “claims challenged in the petition”). This argument, like many such arguments, is a wash.

Neither am I helped by analogizing the inter partes review proceeding to civil litigation. Cf. ante, at 2-3, 5. That is because, as this Court said in Cuozzo, inter partes review is a “hybrid proceeding.” 579 U. S., at ___, 136 S. Ct. 2131, 195 L. Ed. 2d 423, 441. It has some adversarial characteristics, but “in other [**34]  significant respects, inter partes review is less like a judicial proceeding and more like a specialized agency proceeding.” Id., at ___, 136 S. Ct. 2131, 195 L. Ed. 2d 423, 440. Its purposes are not limited to “helping resolve concrete  [***1316]  patent-related disputes among parties,” but extend to “reexamin[ing] . . . an earlier administrative grant of a patent” and “protect[ing] the public’s ‘paramount interest in seeing that patent monopolies . . . are kept within their legitimate scope.’” Ibid. (quoting Precision Instrument Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co., 324 U. S. 806, 816, 65 S. Ct. 993, 89 L. Ed. 1381, 1945 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 582 (1945); ellipsis in original); see also Oil States Energy Services, LLC v. Greene’s Energy Group, LLC, ___ U. S. ___, ___-___, 2018 U.S. LEXIS 2630, *16 (2018).

Finally, I would turn to the likely purposes of the statutory provision. As the majority points out, §314(a) makes clear that the “Director” (now his delegate, the Board) is to determine whether there is a “reasonable likelihood” of success as to at least one of the claims the petition challenges. If not, he cannot initiate an inter partes review proceeding. If so, §314(a) “invests the Director with discretion on the question whether to institute review.” Ante, at 8 (emphasis deleted); Cuozzo, supra, at ___, 136 S. Ct. 2131, 195 L. Ed. 2d 423 (slip op., at 9). As I have said, Patent Office regulations allow the Board to proceed with inter partes review of some of the claims a petitioner challenges (say, only those where there is a reasonable likelihood of [**35]  success), but not of others. 37 CFR §42.108(a).

The majority points out that it does not follow from §314(a) that the statute affords the Director discretion regarding what claims that review will encompass. The text says only that the Director can decide “whether” to institute the requested review, not “whether and to what extent” review should proceed. Ante, at 8 (emphasis deleted). That is certainly so. But I think that when we, as judges, face a difficult text, it is often helpful to ask not just “whether” or “what” but also “why.” Why, asks the Patent Office, would Congress have intended to require the Board to proceed with an inter partes review, take evidence, and hear argument in respect to challenges to claims that the Board had previously determined had no “reasonable likelihood” of success? The statute would seem to give the Director discretion to achieve the opposite, namely, to avoid wasting the Board’s time and effort  [*713]  reviewing challenges that it has already decided have no “reasonable likelihood of success.” In my example, why make the Board do further work on the challenges to claims 1 through 15, which the Board has already decided are near frivolous?

More than that, to read §318(a) as requiring [**36]  a “final written decision” in respect to those 15 perhaps frivolous challenges would seem to lead to judicial review of the Board’s decision about those frivolous challenges. After all, §319 of the statute says that a “party dissatisfied with the final written decision of the [Board] under section 318(a),” the provision before us, “may appeal the decision” to the Federal Circuit. And the majority’s interpretation is anomalous in that it is difficult to imagine why Congress, with one hand, would make the agency’s weeding-out decision nonreviewable, see Cuozzo, supra, at ___-___, 136 S. Ct. 2131, 195 L. Ed. 2d 423, 451, yet at the same time would make the decision reviewable via the requirement that the Board issue a “final written” appealable “decision” with respect to that weeded-out challenge.



III
I end up where I began. Section 318(a) contains a gap just after the words “challenged by the petitioner.” Considerations of context, structure, and purpose do not close the gap. And under Chevron, “where a statute leaves a ‘gap’ or is ‘ambigu[ous],’ we typically interpret it as granting the agency leeway to enact rules that are reasonable in light of the text, nature, and purpose of the statute.” Cuozzo, supra, at ___, 136 S. Ct. 2131, 195 L. Ed. 2d 423, 439 (quoting United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292 (2001); alteration in original).



A
In referring to Chevron, I do not mean that courts are to treat [**37]  that case like a rigid, black-letter rule of law, instructing them always to allow agencies leeway to fill every gap in every statutory provision. See Mead Corp., supra, at 229-231, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292. Rather, I understand Chevron as a rule of thumb, guiding courts in an effort to respect that leeway which Congress intended the agencies to have. I recognize that Congress does not always consider such matters, but if not, courts can often implement a more general, virtually omnipresent congressional purpose—namely, the creation of a well-functioning statutory scheme—by using a canon-like, judicially created construct, the hypothetical reasonable legislator, and asking what such legislators would likely have intended had Congress considered the question of delegating gap-filling authority to the agency.



B
To answer this question, we have previously held that a “statute’s complexity, the vast number of claims that it engenders, and the consequent need for agency expertise and administrative experience” normally “lead us to read [a] statute as delegating to the Agency considerable authority to fill in, through interpretation, matters of detail related to its administration.” Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212, 225, 122 S. Ct. 1265, 152 L. Ed. 2d 330 (2002). These considerations all favor  [***1317]  such a reading here. Indeed, [**38]  the question before us is one of agency administration in respect to detailed matters that an agency working with the statute is particularly likely to understand. In addition, the agency  [*714]  filled the gap here through the exercise of rulemaking authority explicitly given it by Congress to issue regulations “setting forth the standards for the showing of sufficient grounds to institute a review” and “establishing and governing inter partes review.” §§316(a)(2), (4); Cuozzo, 579 U. S., at ___-___, 136 S. Ct. 2131, 195 L. Ed. 2d 423, 439; cf. Mead Corp., supra, at 227, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292. Thus, there is a gap, the agency possesses gap-filling authority, and it filled the gap with a regulation that, for reasons I have stated, is a reasonable exercise of that authority.



***
I consequently would affirm the judgment of the Federal Circuit. And, with respect, I dissent from the Court’s contrary conclusion.
