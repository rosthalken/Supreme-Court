134 S. Ct. 2384
KEVIN LOUGHRIN, Petitioner v. UNITED STATES
Supreme Court of the United States
April 1, 2014, Argued; June 23, 2014, Decided
No. 13-316

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

I join Parts I and II of the Court’s opinion, Part III-A except the last paragraph, and the last footnote in Part III-B. I do not join the remainder of Part III-B.

I agree with the Court that neither intent to defraud a bank nor exposure of a bank to a risk of loss is an element  [***29] of the crime codified in 18 U. S. C. §1344(2). But I am dubitante on the point that one obtains bank property “by means of” a fraudulent statement only if that statement is “the mechanism naturally inducing a bank (or custodian of bank property) to part with money in its control,” ante, at ___ - ___, 134 S. Ct. 2384, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 424. The Government suggested that test, but only briefly claimed it was to be found in the “by means of” language, Brief for United States 40-41—so briefly that Loughrin responded that “[t]he Government does not claim any textual basis for this [naturally inducing] rule,” Reply Brief 13. We have heard scant argument (nothing but the Government’s bare-bones assertion) in favor of the “by means of” textual limitation, and no adversary presentation whatever opposing it. The Court’s opinion raises the subject in order to reply to Loughrin’s argument that, unless we adopt his proposed nontextual limitations, all frauds effected by receipt of a check will become federal crimes. It seems to me enough to say that Loughrin’s solutions to the problem of the statute’s sweep are, for the reasons well explained by the Court’s opinion, not correct. What the proper solution may be should in my view be left for  [***30] another day. I discuss below my difficulties with the “by means of” solution.

 [**427]  Recall the Court’s hypothetical garden-variety con. “A fraudster [makes a statement] pass[ing] off a cheap knock-off as a Louis Vuitton handbag. The victim pays for the bag with a good check, which the criminal cashes.” Ante, at ___, 134 S. Ct. 2384, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 423. The fraudster unquestionably has obtained bank property. But how? By presenting the check to a bank teller, yes. But also by duping the buyer. Yet according to the  [*2396]  Court, the fraudster’s deceit was not a “means” of obtaining the cash, because tricking a buyer into swapping a check for a counterfeit carryall is not a “mechanism naturally inducing a bank . . . to part with money in its control.” Ante, at ___, 134 S. Ct. 2384, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 424. The bank’s involvement, it says, is mere happenstance.

I do not know where the Court’s crabbed definition of “means” comes from. Certainly not the dictionary entries that it quotes. Quite the contrary, those suggest that the handbag fraudster’s deceitful statement was a “means”: Undoubtedly, the trickery was a “‘method, or course of action, by the employment of which [bank property was] attained.’” Ante, at ___, 134 S. Ct. 2384, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 424. Though the dictionaries do not appear to add that the connection  [***31] between “means” and end must be “something more than oblique, indirect, and incidental,” ibid., I agree that, in common usage, not every but-for cause of an act is a cause “by means of” which the act has occurred. No one would say, for example, that the handbag fraudster obtained bank property by means of his ancestors’ emigration to the United States. But all would say, I think, that he obtained the property by means of the lie. His deceit is far from merely incidental to, or an oblique or indirect way of, obtaining the money. That was the lie’s very purpose.

That the fraudster likely was indifferent to the victim’s method of payment—making his receipt of bank money instead of straight cash merely “fortuitous,” ante, at ___, 134 S. Ct. 2384, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 425—does not suggest, in ordinary parlance, that the fraud was not a means of acquiring bank property. Indeed, saying that indifference is disqualifying comes close to requiring the intent to defraud a bank that the Court properly rejects. In any case, indifference certainly does not cause what is a means not to be a means. Suppose I resolve to purchase (with the two dollars in my billfold) a coffee at the first convenience store I pass on my way to work. I am indifferent  [***32] to what store that might be. I catch sight of a 7-Eleven, pull in, and, with my cash, buy the drink. That it is a 7-Eleven coffee rather than a Sheetz coffee is “wholly fortuitous,” ibid. Still, no one would say that I had not obtained 7-Eleven coffee by means of my two dollars. So too with the handbag swindler: Regardless of whether the cash is the victim’s or, technically, the bank’s, and regardless of whether the swindler cared which it was, would we not say that the fraudster has obtained it by means of the trick?

The majority responds that the measure of “means” is not indifference or the absence of fortuity but rather directness. And not just proximate-cause-like directness—the fraudulent statement literally must “reach the bank,” ante, at ___, n. 8, 134 S. Ct. 2384, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 425. Once again, it seems to me the Court’s definition does not accord with common usage. Suppose little Bobby falsely tells his mother that he got an A on his weekly spelling test and so deserves an extra  [**428]  cookie after dinner. Mother will not be home for dinner, but she leaves a note for Father: “Bobby gets an extra cookie after dinner tonight.” (Much like the handbag buyer’s note to the bank: “Pay  [***33] $2,000 to the order of Mr. Handbag Fraudster.”) Dinner wraps up, and Bobby gets his second cookie. Has he obtained it by means of the fib to his mother? Plainly yes, an ordinary English speaker would say. But plainly no under the Court’s definition, since the lie did not make its way to the father.

The Court’s chief illustration of its “by means of” gloss seems to me contrived. If “Jane traded in her car for money to take a bike trip cross-country, no one would say she ‘crossed the Rockies by means of a car.’” Ante, at ___, 134 S. Ct. 2384, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 424. Of course. By using  [*2397]  two vehicles of conveyance, and describing the end in question as “crossing the Rockies,” the statement that the car was the “means” of achieving that end invites one to think that Jane traveled by automobile. But the proper question—the one parallel to the question whether the fraudster obtained bank funds by means of fraudulently selling the counterfeit—is not whether Jane crossed the Rockies by means of the car, but whether she funded her trip by means of selling the car. Which she assuredly did. Just as the handbag swindler, in the Louis Vuitton example, obtained money by means of his false representation.

I certainly agree that this statute  [***34] must be interpreted, if possible, in a manner that will not make every fraud effected by receipt of a check a federal offense. But deciding this case does not require us to identify that manner, and I would leave that for another case.

Justice Alito, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

I agree with the Court’s holding that 18 U. S. C. §1344(2) requires neither intent to defraud a bank nor the creation of a risk of financial loss to a bank, but I must write separately to express disagreement with some dicta in the opinion of the Court.

In a few passages, the Court suggests that §1344(2) requires a mens rea of purpose. See ante, at ___, 134 S. Ct. 2384, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 419 (“[T]he clause requires that the defendant intend ‘to obtain any of the moneys . . . or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution’” (ellipsis in original)); ante, at ___, n. 6, 134 S. Ct. 2384, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 424 (“[W]hen the defendant has the requisite intent to acquire bank property, his presentation of a forged or altered check to a third party satisfies §1344(2)’s ‘means’ requirement”). *Link to the text of the note That is incorrect.

Congress expressly  [***35] denoted the mens rea a defendant must have to violate §1344(2), and it is not purpose. Instead, §1344(2) imposes liability on “[w]hoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice” to obtain bank property. (Emphasis added.) It is hard to imagine how Congress could have been clearer as to the mental state required for liability.

The Court’s contrary statements apparently derive from the fact that the criminal venture that a defendant must knowingly execute or attempt to  [**429]  execute must be a scheme or artifice “to obtain . . . property owned by . . . a financial institution.” §1344(2). A defendant must have the purpose to obtain bank property, so the argument goes, because he must execute a scheme the purpose of which is to obtain bank property.

This argument confuses the design of the scheme with the mens rea of the defendant. The statute requires only that the objective of the scheme must be the obtaining of bank property, not that the defendant must have such an objective. Of course, in many cases a scheme’s objective will be the same as an individual defendant’s. Where the defendant acts alone, for instance, his objective will almost certainly be the same as that  [***36] of the scheme, and the inquiry into the defendant’s mens rea and the scheme’s objective will accordingly merge. But in some cases, such as those involving large, complex criminal ventures, a given defendant’s purpose may diverge from the scheme’s objective. For instance, a defendant who is paid by a large ring of check forgers to  [*2398]  present one of their forged checks to a bank for payment has executed “a scheme or artifice . . . to obtain” bank property, even if he only presents the check because he is paid to do so and personally does not care whether the forged check is honored. That is because the objective of the scheme as a whole is to obtain bank property, and the defendant knowingly executes that scheme.

The majority reads the word “knowingly” out of the statute. That term “‘requires proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.’” Dixon v. United States, 548 U. S. 1, 5, 126 S. Ct. 2437, 165 L. Ed. 2d 299 (2006). If the majority is correct that the language “a scheme or artifice . . . to obtain” bank property demands that the defendant intend to obtain bank property, then the word “knowingly” is superfluous, because a defendant whose purpose is to obtain bank property will always know that his purpose  [***37] is to obtain bank property. Why would Congress expressly specify a lesser mens rea element if elsewhere in the statute it commands a greater, subsuming one?

Proof that a defendant acted knowingly very often gives rise to a reasonable inference that the defendant also acted purposely, and therefore the Court’s dicta may not have much practical effect. But if the issue is presented in a future case, the Court’s statements must be regarded as dicta. The Court’s statements that a defendant must intend to obtain bank property to be convicted under §1344(2) are unnecessary to its conclusion that a defendant may be convicted under this provision without proof that he either intended to defraud a bank or created a risk of loss to a bank. Furthermore, as the Court makes clear, petitioner waived any challenge to his conviction arising from an asserted statutory requirement that he must have intended to obtain bank property. See ante, at ___, n. 3, 134 S. Ct. 2384, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 420.
