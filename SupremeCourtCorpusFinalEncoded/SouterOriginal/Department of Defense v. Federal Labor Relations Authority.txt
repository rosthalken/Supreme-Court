UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY ET AL.

No. 92-1223

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

114 S. Ct. 1006

November 8, 1993, Argued 
February 23, 1994, Decided

JUSTICE SOUTER, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion with the understanding that it does not ultimately resolve the relationship between the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Labor Statute) and all of the Privacy Act of 1974 exceptions potentially available to respondents, and that any more general language in the opinion is limited, as the Court notes, to the relationship between the Labor Statute and the Freedom of Information Act exception to the Privacy Act at issue here. See ante, at 494, n.5.
