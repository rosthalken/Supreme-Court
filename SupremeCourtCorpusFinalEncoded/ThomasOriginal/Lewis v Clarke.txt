BRIAN LEWIS, et al., Petitioners v. WILLIAM CLARKE

No. 15-1500.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

137 S. Ct. 1285

January 9, 2017, Argued 
April 25, 2017, Decided

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.
I remain of the view that tribal immunity does not extend “to suits arising out of a tribe’s commercial activities conducted beyond its territory.” Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U. S. ___, 134 S. Ct. 2024, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1071, 1100 (2014) (dissenting opinion); see also Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U. S. 751, 764, 118 S. Ct. 1700, 140 L. Ed. 2d 981 (1998) (Stevens, J.,    dissenting). This suit arose from an off-reservation commercial act. Ante, at ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 637. Accordingly, I would hold that respondent cannot assert the Tribe’s immunity, regardless of the capacity in which he was sued. Because the Court reaches the same result for different reasons, I concur in its judgment.
