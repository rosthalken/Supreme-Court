As I stated in my dissenting opinion in Shea v. Louisiana, 470 U.S. 51, 61 (1985), I am willing to adopt both aspects of the approach to retroactivity propounded by Justice Harlan in his opinion in Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 675 (1971). In Justice Harlan's view, new constitutional rules governing criminal prosecutions should apply retroactively for cases pending on direct appeal when the rule is announced, and, with narrow exceptions, should not apply in collateral proceedings challenging    convictions that become final before the rule is announced. The majority today adopts only a portion of this approach. I     therefore join JUSTICE WHITE's dissent, agreeing with him that, under the present state of our retroactivity    jurisprudence, the majority erred in rejecting the reasons cited in Allen v. Hardy, 478 U.S. 255 (1986), for making Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), nonretroactive.
