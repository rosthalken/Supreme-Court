JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

This case presents the question whether, after a defendant pleads guilty or is convicted, the Sixth Amendment permits defense counsel simply to walk away, leaving the defendant uncounseled about his appeal rights. The Court is not  [*494]  deeply divided on this question. Both the Court and JUSTICE SOUTER effectively [***1006]  respond: hardly ever. Because [****44]  the test articulated by JUSTICE SOUTER provides clearer guidance to lower courts and to counsel, and because I think it plain that the duty to consult was not satisfied in this case, I join JUSTICE SOUTER's opinion.
