459 U.S. 297
DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR v. PERINI NORTH RIVER ASSOCIATES ET AL.
Supreme Court of the United States
October 4, 1982, Argued ; January 11, 1983, Decided
No. 81-897 

JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concurring in the judgment.
At the time of his injury, Churchill was engaged in unloading materials from a supply barge to a cargo barge. This work is very much like the work of longshoremen, who typically load and unload vessels. Therefore Churchill was "engaged in maritime employment" within the meaning of § 2(3) of the Act, and was within its coverage. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.
