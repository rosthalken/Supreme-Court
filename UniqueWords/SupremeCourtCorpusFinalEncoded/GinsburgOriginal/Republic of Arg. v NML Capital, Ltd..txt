[*2259]  Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.

The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330, 1602 et seq., if one of several conditions is met, permits execution of a judgment rendered in the United States against a foreign sovereign only on “property in the United States . . . used for a commercial activity.” § 1610(a). Accordingly, no inquiry into a foreign sovereign’s property in the United States that is not “used for a commercial activity” could be ordered; such an  [***22] inquiry, as the Court recognizes, would not be “‘relevant’ to execution in the first place.” Ante, at ___, 134 S. Ct. 2250, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 243 (citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(1)). Yet the Court permits  [**245]  unlimited inquiry into Argentina’s property outside the United States, whether or not the property is “used for a commercial activity.” By what authorization does a court in the United States become a “clearinghouse for information,” ante, at ___, 134 S. Ct. 2250, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 239 (internal quotation marks omitted), about any and all property held by Argentina abroad? NML may seek such information, the Court reasons, because “NML does not yet know what property Argentina has [outside the United States], let alone whether it is executable under the relevant jurisdiction’s law.” Ante, at ___, 134 S. Ct. 2250, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 243. But see Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v. United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 482 U.S. 522, 542, 107 S. Ct. 2542, 96 L. Ed. 2d 461 (1987) (observing that other jurisdictions generally allow much more limited discovery than is available in the United States).

A court in the United States has no warrant to indulge the assumption that, outside our country, the sky may be the limit for attaching a foreign sovereign’s property in order to execute a U. S. judgment against the foreign  [***23] sovereign. Cf. § 1602 (“Under international law, . . . th[e] commercial property [of a state] may be levied upon for the satisfaction of judgments rendered against [the state] in connection with [its] commercial activities.” (emphasis added)). Without proof of any kind that other nations broadly expose a foreign sovereign’s property to arrest, attachment or execution, a more modest assumption is in order. See EM Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 695 F. 3d 201, 207 (CA2 2012) (recognizing that postjudgment discovery “must be calculated to assist in collecting on a judgment” (citing Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 26(b)(1), 69(a)(2))).

Unless and until the judgment creditor, here, NML, proves that other nations would allow unconstrained access to Argentina’s assets, I would be guided by the one law we know for sure—our own. That guide is all the more appropriate, as our law coincides with the international norm. See § 1602. Accordingly, I would limit NML’s discovery to property used here or abroad “in connection with . . . commercial activities.” §§ 1602, 1610(a). I therefore dissent from the sweeping examination of Argentina’s worldwide assets the Court exorbitantly approves today.
