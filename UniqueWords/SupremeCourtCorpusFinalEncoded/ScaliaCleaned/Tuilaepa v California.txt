
It is my view that once a State has adopted a methodology to narrow the eligibility for the death penalty, thereby ensuring that its imposition is not “freakish,” Wainwright v. Goode, 464 U.S. 78, 87, 104 S.Ct. 378, 383, 78 L.Ed.2d 187 (1983) (per curiam), the distinctive procedural requirements of the Eighth Amendment have been exhausted. See Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639, 669–673, 110 S.Ct. 3047, 3065–3068, 111 L.Ed.2d 511 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Today’s decision adheres to our cases which acknowledge additional requirements, but since it restricts their further expansion it moves in the right direction. For that reason, and without abandoning my prior views, I join the opinion of the Court.
