JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.

In United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117 (1980), this Court upheld the constitutionality of a federal statute that permitted Government appeals from certain sentences. Today, the Court summarily reverses because it finds that the "Pennsylvania Supreme Court's rationale is inconsistent with the rationale of the holding of this Court in DiFrancesco." Ante, at 29.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court opinion does not mention DiFrancesco. The appellate briefs before the Pennsylvania court did consider that case, however. 1Link to the text of the note Indeed, Mr. Goldhammer argued that DiFrancesco  [***188]  did not govern precisely because no Pennsylvania statute authorized government appeals of sentences at the time of his conviction and sentencing. 2Link to the text of the note Mr. Goldhammer has  [**355]  raised the same argument  [*32]  before this Court in his response [****8]  to the Commonwealth's petition. 3Link to the text of the note Moreover, it should be noted that, unlike the situation in DiFrancesco, the Pennsylvania prosecutor made no attempt to take an appeal from the sentences imposed by the trial court. The Commonwealth, in its petition and in its reply, has not adequately addressed these points.

The majority recognizes that the Pennsylvania court's judgment may ultimately be supported by state-law grounds. See ante, at 30-31. In view of that uncertainty, and in view  [****9]  of the Commonwealth's failure to address this important issue, I would simply deny certiorari. 4Link to the text of the note I would presume that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined that DiFrancesco did not govern for the plausible state-law reason that had been argued to it.

Three factors support this presumption. First, Pennsylvania's current statutory framework for permitting government appeals from sentences was not in place at the time of Mr. Goldhammer's conviction and sentencing. 5Link to the text of the note Second, Pennsylvania courts are now applying the new statutory framework, 6Link to the text of the note with full knowledge of DiFrancesco. 7Link to the text of the note Third,  [*33]  and perhaps most importantly, we should assume that a State Supreme Court is familiar with this Court's precedents and with its own State's law. Because [****10]  the majority's summary reversal reflects a contrary assumption, I respectfully dissent.
