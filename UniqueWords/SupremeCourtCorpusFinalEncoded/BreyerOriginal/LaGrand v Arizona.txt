Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Stevens, dissenting:

For the reasons set forth in my opinion dissenting from the denial of a stay in Federal Republic of Germany v. United States, No. 127, Orig., and because this petition for certiorari in part raises similar issues, I would grant a stay of execution.
