4 Id., at 6.
5 387 F.3d at 1222, n.1 (noting that our decision in Nguyen v. United States, 539 U.S. 69, 156 L. Ed. 2d 64, 123 S. Ct. 2130 (2003), was not a jurisdictional holding).


I agree that there are legitimate prudential reasons for denying certiorari in this somewhat unusual case. That being said, it would be a mistake to assume that our disposition of this petition constitutes a decision on the merits of whether the President has the constitutional authority to fill future Article III vacancies, such as vacancies on this Court, with appointments made absent consent of the Senate during short intrasession "recesses."
