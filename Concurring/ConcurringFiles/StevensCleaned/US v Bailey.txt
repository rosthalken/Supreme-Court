The essential difference between the majority and the dissent is over the question whether the record contains enough evidence of a bona fide effort to surrender or return to custody to present a question of fact for the jury to resolve. On this issue, I agree with the Court that the evidence introduced by defendants Cooley, Bailey, and Cogdell was plainly insufficient.     Vague references to anonymous intermediaries are so inherently incredible that a trial judge is entitled to ignore them. With respect to Walker, however, the question is much closer because he testified that he personally telephoned an FBI agent three times in an effort to negotiate a surrender. 1Link to the text of the note But since he remained at large for about two months after his last effort to speak with the FBI, I am persuaded that even under his version of the facts he did not make an adequate attempt to satisfy the    return requirement.

The fact that I have joined the Court's opinion does not indicate that I -- or indeed that any other Member of the majority -- is unconcerned about prison conditions described by MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN. Because we are construing the federal escape statute, however, I think it only fair to note that such conditions are more apt to prevail in state or county facilities than in federal facilities. 2Link to the text of the note Moreover, reasonable men     may     well differ about the most effective methods of redressing the situation. In my view, progress toward acceptable solutions involves formulating enforceable objective standards for civilized prison conditions, 3Link to the text of the note keeping the channels of communication between prisoners and the outside world open, 4Link to the text of the note and guaranteeing access to the courts,     5Link to the text of the note    rather than relying on ad hoc judgments about the good faith of     prison administrators, 6Link to the text of the note giving undue deference to their "expertise" 7Link to the text of the note or encouraging self-help by convicted felons. 8Link to the text of the note In short, neither my agreement with much of what MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN has written, nor my disagreement with the Court about related issues, prevents me from joining its construction of the federal escape statute.

The rebuttal testimony described by the Court, ante, at 399, n. 2, indicates that Walker was probably not telling the truth; but in deciding whether Walker's testimony was sufficient, I assume its veracity.

8Link to the location of the note in the document
It would be unwise, and perhaps counterproductive, to immunize escapes that would otherwise be unlawful in the hope that they would motivate significant reforms. "An unselfish motive affords no assurance that a crime will produce the results its perpetrator intends." United States v. Cullen, 454 F.2d 386, 392, n. 17 (CA7 1971). Minimizing the risk of escape is, of course, the classic justification for imposing rigid discipline within prison walls.
