Supreme Court of the United States
Michael ROSS, Petitioner
v.
Shaidon BLAKE.
No. 15–339.
|
Argued March 29, 2016.
|
Decided June 6, 2016.
Justice THOMAS, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

I join the Court’s opinion except for the discussion of Maryland’s prison-grievance procedures, ante, at 1854 – 1862, which needlessly wades into respondent Shaidon Blake’s questionable lodgings of new documents in this Court. Those documents are not part of the appellate record. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 10(a). We have “consistently condemned” attempts to influence our decisions by submitting “additional or different evidence that is not part of the certified record.” S. Shapiro, K. Geller, T. Bishop, E. Hartnett, & D. Himmelfarb, Supreme Court Practice § 13.11(k), p. 743 (10th ed. 2013). Perhaps Blake’s newfound documents are subject to judicial notice as public records. See Fed. Rule Evid. 201. But I would not take such notice for the first time in this Court. It appears that Blake had a chance to submit many of his documents to the lower courts and failed to do so. Taking notice of the documents encourages gamesmanship and frustrates our review. I would let the Court of Appeals decide on remand whether to supplement the record, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 10(e), or take notice of Blake’s lodgings.
