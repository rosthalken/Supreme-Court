TERRY STEWART, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL. v. WALTER LAGRAND

No. A-735 (98-1412)

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

119 S. Ct. 1018

March 3, 1999, Decided

JUSTICE SOUTER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG and JUSTICE BREYER join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I join Part I of the Per Curiam Opinion, on the understanding that petitioner makes no claim that death by lethal [*121]  injection would be cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment. I do not reach any issue of the applicability of Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334, 109 S. Ct. 1060 (1989).
