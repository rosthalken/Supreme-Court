Supreme Court of the United States
Wes WISE, Mayor of the City of Dallas, et al., Petitioners,
v.
Albert L. LIPSCOMB et al.
No. 77–529.
|
Argued April 26, 1978.
|
Decided June 22, 1978.

Opinion of Mr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice STEWART, and Mr. Justice POWELL join.
I write separately to emphasize that the Court today is not presented with the question of whether the District Court erred in concluding that the form of government of the city of *550 Dallas unconstitutionally diluted the voting power of black citizens. While this Court has found that the use of multi-member districts in a state legislative apportionment plan may be invalid if “used invidiously to cancel out or minimize the voting strength of racial groups,” White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 765, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 2339, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973), we have never had occasion to consider whether an analogue of this highly amorphous theory may be applied to municipal governments. Since petitioners did not preserve this issue on appeal, we need not today consider whether relevant constitutional distinctions may be drawn in this area between a state legislature and a municipal government. I write only to point out that the possibility of such distinctions has not been foreclosed by today’s decision.
