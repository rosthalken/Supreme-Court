This present petition, however, seeks our intervention before the litigation below has come to final judgment. The Court of Appeals vacated the judgment that had been entered in favor of petitioners, and remanded the case to the District Court for determination of an appropriate remedy. It expressly declined to rule on the    "specific remedial course that the Commonwealth should or must follow hereafter," and suggested permissible remedies other than compelling the Virginia Military Institute to abandon its current     admissions policy. United States v. Virginia, 976 F.2d 890, 900 (CA4 1992).

We generally await final judgment in the lower courts before exercising our certiorari jurisdiction. See, e. g., American Construction Co. v. Jacksonville, T & K. W. R. Co., 148 U.S. 372, 384, 37 L. Ed. 486, 13 S. Ct. 758 (1893); Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen & Enginemen v. Bangor & Aroostook R. Co., 389 U.S. 327, 328, 19 L. Ed. 2d 560, 88 S. Ct. 437 (1967) (per curiam); see generally R. Stern, E. Gressman, & S. Shapiro, Supreme Court Practice § 4.18, pp. 224-226 (6th ed. 1986). I think it prudent to take that course here. Our action does not, of course, preclude VMI from raising the same issues in a later petition, after final judgment has been rendered. See, e.g., Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Bros. & Co., 240 U.S. 251, 257-259, 60 L. Ed. 629, 36 S. Ct. 269 (1916); Hughes Tool Co. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 409 U.S. 363, 365-366, 34 L. Ed. 2d 577, 93 S. Ct. 647 , n.1 (1973);     Stern, Gressman, & Shapiro, supra, § 4.18, at 226; 17 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4036, p. 32 (2d ed. 1988).
