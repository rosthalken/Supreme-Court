JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

I agree with the Court that in Garvey v. Roberts, 203 F.3d 580 (CA9 2000) (Garvey I), the Ninth Circuit should not have disturbed the arbitrator's award. Correction of that error sets this case straight. I see no need to say more.
