Toforest Onesha Johnson, Petitioner v. Alabama.

No. 16-7835.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

137 S. Ct. 2292

June 26, 2017, Decided

The Chief Justice, with whom Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting: The Court vacates the judgment below in light of the position asserted by the respondent in its brief. That position is that the Court should vacate a state court judgment for further consideration in light of Ex parte Beckworth, 190 So. 3d 571 (Ala. 2013). Beckworth is a state court decision that turns entirely on state procedural  [**721]  law. It was expressly called to the attention of  [*2293]  the state courts, which declined to upset the decision below in light of it. Reply to Pet. for Cert. 2, n. 1. The question presented concerns state collateral review—purely a creature of state law that need not be provided at all. Whatever one’s view on the propriety of our practice of vacating judgments based on positions of the parties, see Hicks v. United States, 582 U. S. ___, 2017 U.S. LEXIS 4265 (2017), the Court’s decision    to vacate this state court judgment is truly extraordinary. I respectfully dissent.
