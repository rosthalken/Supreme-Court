
I join the Court’s opinion. Though the Court has properly applied our dormant Commerce Clause precedents, I continue *1721 to adhere to my view that “[t]he negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the text of the Constitution, makes little sense, and has proved virtually unworkable in application, and, consequently, cannot serve as a basis for striking down a state statute.” Hillside Dairy Inc. v. Lyons, 539 U.S. 59, 68, 123 S.Ct. 2142, 156 L.Ed.2d 54 (2003) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
