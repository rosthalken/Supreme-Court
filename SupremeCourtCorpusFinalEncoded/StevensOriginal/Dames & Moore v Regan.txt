JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part.

In my judgment the possibility that requiring this petitioner to  [***947]  prosecute its [****63]  claim in another forum will constitute an unconstitutional "taking" is so remote that I would not address the jurisdictional question considered in Part V of the Court's opinion. However, I join the remainder of the opinion.
