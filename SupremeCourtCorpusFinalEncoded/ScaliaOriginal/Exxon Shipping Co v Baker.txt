Supreme Court of the United States
EXXON SHIPPING COMPANY, et al., Petitioners,
v.
Grant BAKER et al.
No. 07–219.
|
Argued Feb. 27, 2008.
|
Decided June 25, 2008.
Synopsis
Background: After third remand for reconsideration of punitive damages in a suit arising from the 1989 grounding of an oil supertanker in Alaska, the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, H. Russel Holland, Chief Judge, 296 F.Supp.2d 1071, entered a $4.5 billion award of punitive damages against oil company, and parties filed cross-appeals. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 490 F.3d 1066, vacated and remanded for reduction of the punitive damages award to $2.5 billion, and certiorari was granted.
 
Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court, including the portions that refer to constitutional limits that prior opinions have imposed upon punitive damages. While I agree with the argumentation based upon those prior holdings, I continue to believe the holdings were in error. See State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 429, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).
