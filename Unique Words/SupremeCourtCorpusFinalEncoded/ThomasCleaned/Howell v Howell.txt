I join all of the opinion of the Court except its brief discussion of “purposes and objectives” pre-emption. Ante, at ___, 137 S. Ct. 1400, 197 L. Ed. 2d at 788. As I have previously explained, “[t]hat framework is an illegitimate basis for finding the preemption of state law.” Hillman v. Maretta, 569 U.S. ___, ___, 133 S. Ct. 1943, 186 L. Ed. 2d 43, 58 (2013) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); see also Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 583, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51 (2009) (same). In any event, that framework is not necessary to support the Court’s judgment in this case.
