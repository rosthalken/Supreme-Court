Supreme Court of the United States
TENNESSEE, Petitioner,
v.
George LANE et al.
No. 02–1667.
|
Argued Jan. 13, 2004.
|
Decided May 17, 2004.
Justice THOMAS, dissenting.

I join THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent. I agree that Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 cannot be a *566 congruent and proportional remedy to the States’ alleged practice of denying disabled persons access to the courts. Not only did Congress fail to identify any evidence of such a practice when it enacted the ADA, ante, at 1998–2003, Title II regulates far more than the provision of access to the courts, ante, at 2003–2006. Because I joined the dissent in Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 123 S.Ct. 1972, 155 L.Ed.2d 953 (2003), and continue to believe that Hibbs was wrongly decided, I write separately only to disavow any reliance on Hibbs in reaching this conclusion.
