Supreme Court of the United States
UNITED STATES, Petitioner
v.
PROVIDENCE JOURNAL COMPANY and Charles M. Hauser.
No. 87–65.
|
Argued Jan. 20, 1988.
|
Decided May 2, 1988.

Justice SCALIA, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court, which ably demonstrates that according 28 U.S.C. § 518(a) its plain meaning is fully consistent with the opinion of the Court in Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S.A., 481 U.S. 787, 107 S.Ct. 2124, 95 L.Ed.2d 740 (1987). I continue to believe, however, that district courts possess no power, inherent or otherwise, to prosecute contemners for disobedience of court judgments and no derivative power to appoint an attorney to conduct contempt prosecutions. See id., at 825, 107 S.Ct., at 2147 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).
