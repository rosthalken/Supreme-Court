REPUBLIC NATIONAL BANK OF MIAMI, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

No. 91-767

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

506 U.S. 80

October 5, 1992, Argued 
December 14, 1992, Decided

[*99]  JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
While I agree with JUSTICE BLACKMUN's analysis of the Government's Appropriations Clause argument, and join his opinion in its entirety, I also agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that 31 U.S. C. § 1304, together with 28 U.S. C. § 2465, provide a satisfactory alternative response. Moreover, like JUSTICE WHITE, and for the reasons stated in his separate opinion, I am surprised that the Government would make "such a transparently fallacious" argument in support of its unconscionable position in this case. See ante, at 96.
