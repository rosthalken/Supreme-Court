PERVIS TYRONE PAYNE, PETITIONER v. TENNESSEE

No. 90-5721

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

498 U.S. 1076

February 15, 1991, Decided

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Marshall and Justice Blackmun join, dissenting: In my opinion, the Court's decision to expedite the consideration of this case and to ask [***2]  the parties to address whether we should overrule Booth v. Maryland, 482 U.S. 496 (1987) and South Carolina v. Gathers, 490 U.S. 805 (1989), a question presented neither in the petition for certiorari nor in the response, is both unwise and unnecessary. Cf. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 485 U.S. 617, 622-623 (1988) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Moreover, the Court's decision to review the alleged Booth error in this case would be inappropriate in any event because the decision below rested alternatively on the ground that any Booth violation  [*1077]  that might have occurred was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Payne, 791 S.W.2d 10, 19 (Tenn. 1990). Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
