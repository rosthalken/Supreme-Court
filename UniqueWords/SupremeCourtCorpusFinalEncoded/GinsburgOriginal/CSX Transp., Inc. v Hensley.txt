Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.

The Court's opinion in Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Ayers, 538 U.S. 135, 123 S. Ct. 1210, 155 L. Ed. 2d 261 (2003), would support  [****15] this plain and simple instruction: "It is incumbent upon [the plaintiff] to prove that his  [***1192] alleged fear [of cancer] is genuine and serious," id., at 157, 123 S. Ct. 1210, 155 L. Ed. 2d 261. The defense-oriented instructions requested, however, were far more elaborate, compare ante, at 839-840, 173 L. Ed. 2d, at 1187 (per curiam), with App. to Pet. for Cert. 70a-71a, and the trial court rightly refused to give them. Nothing in Ayers required the court to deliver, on its own initiative, a fitting substitute. I would therefore deny the petition for certiorari and dissent from the Court's summary reversal.
