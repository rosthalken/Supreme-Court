Supreme Court of the United States
William H. WEBSTER, Director of Central Intelligence, Petitioner
v.
John DOE.
No. 86–1294.
|
Argued Jan. 12, 1988.
|
Decided June 15, 1988.
Justice SCALIA, dissenting.

I agree with the Court’s apparent holding in Part II of its opinion, ante, at 2053, that the Director’s decision to terminate a CIA employee is “committed to agency discretion by law” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). But because I do not see how a decision can, either practically or legally, be both unreviewable and yet reviewable for constitutional defect, I regard Part III of the opinion as essentially undoing Part II. I therefore respectfully dissent from the judgment of the Court.
 

I
Before proceeding to address Part III of the Court’s opinion, which I think to be in error, I must discuss one significant element of the analysis in Part II. Though I subscribe to most of that analysis, I disagree with the Court’s description of what is required to come within subsection (a)(2) of § 701, which provides that judicial review is unavailable “to the extent that ... agency action is committed to agency discretion *607 by law.”* The Court’s discussion, ante, at 2051, suggests that the Court of Appeals below was correct in holding that this provision is triggered only when there is “no law to apply.” See Doe v. **2056 Casey, 254 U.S.App.D.C. 282, 291–293, 796 F.2d 1508, 1517–1519 (1986). But see id., at 305–307, 796 F.2d, at 1531–1533 (Buckley, J., dissenting). Our precedents amply show that “commit [ment] to agency discretion by law” includes, but is not limited to, situations in which there is “no law to apply.”
 
The Court relies for its “no law to apply” formulation upon our discussion in Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985)—which, however, did not apply that as the sole criterion of § 701(a)(2)’s applicability, but to the contrary discussed the subject action’s “general unsuitability” for review, and adverted to “tradition, case law, and sound reasoning.” 470 U.S., at 831, 105 S.Ct. at 1655. Moreover, the only supporting authority for the “no law to apply” test cited in Chaney was our observation in Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971), that “[t]he legislative history of the Administrative Procedure Act indicates that [§ 701(a)(2) ] is applicable in those rare instances where ‘statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.’ S.Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1945),” id., at 410. Perhaps Overton Park discussed only the “no law to apply” factor because that was the only basis for nonreviewability *608 that was even arguably applicable. It surely could not have believed that factor to be exclusive, for that would contradict the very legislative history, both cited and quoted in the opinion, from which it had been derived, which read in full: “The basic exception of matters committed to agency discretion would apply even if not stated at the outset [of the judicial review Chapter]. If, for example, statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply, courts of course have no statutory question to review.” S.Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1945) (emphasis added).
 
The “no law to apply” test can account for the nonreviewability of certain issues, but falls far short of explaining the full scope of the areas from which the courts are excluded. For the fact is that there is no governmental decision that is not subject to a fair number of legal constraints precise enough to be susceptible of judicial application—beginning with the fundamental constraint that the decision must be taken in order to further a public purpose rather than a purely private interest; yet there are many governmental decisions that are not at all subject to judicial review. A United States Attorney’s decision to prosecute, for example, will not be reviewed on the claim that it was prompted by personal animosity. Thus, “no law to apply” provides much less than the full answer to whether § 701(a)(2) applies.
 
The key to understanding the “committed to agency discretion by law” provision of § 701(a)(2) lies in contrasting it with the “statutes preclude judicial review” provision of § 701(a)(1). Why “statutes” for preclusion, but the much more general term “law” for commission to agency discretion? The answer is, as we implied in Chaney, that the latter was intended to refer to “the ‘common law’ of judicial review of agency action,” 470 U.S., at 832, 105 S.Ct. at 1656—a body of jurisprudence that had marked out, with more or less precision, certain issues and certain areas that were beyond the range of judicial review. That jurisprudence included principles *609 ranging from the “political question” doctrine, to sovereign immunity (including doctrines determining when a suit against an officer would be deemed to be a suit against the sovereign), to official immunity, to prudential limitations upon the courts’ equitable powers, to what can be described no more precisely than a traditional respect for the functions of the other branches reflected in the statement in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 170–171, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803), that “[w]here the head of a department acts in a case, in which executive discretion is to be exercised; in which he is the mere organ of executive will; it is again repeated, that any application to a **2057 court to control, in any respect, his conduct, would be rejected without hesitation.” See, e.g., Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 110–114, 68 S.Ct. 431, 435–38, 92 L.Ed. 568 (1948); Switchmen v. National Mediation Board, 320 U.S. 297, 301–306, 64 S.Ct. 95, 97–100, 88 L.Ed. 61, 19 L.Ed. 196 (1943); United States v. George S. Bush & Co., 310 U.S. 371, 379–380, 60 S.Ct. 944, 946–947, 84 L.Ed. 1259 (1940); Reaves v. Ainsworth, 219 U.S. 296, 306 (1911); Confiscation Cases, 7 Wall. 454, 457–459, 19 L.Ed. 196 (1869); Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 29–30 (1827). Only if all that “common law” were embraced within § 701(a)(2) could it have been true that, as was generally understood, “[t]he intended result of [§ 701(a) ] is to restate the existing law as to the area of reviewable agency action.” Attorney General’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 94 (1947). Because that is the meaning of the provision, we have continued to take into account for purposes of determining reviewability, post–APA as before, not only the text and structure of the statute under which the agency acts, but such factors as whether the decision involves “a sensitive and inherently discretionary judgment call,” Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527, 108 S.Ct. 818, 824, 98 L.Ed.2d 918 (1988), whether it is the sort of decision that has traditionally been nonreviewable, ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U.S. 270, 282, 107 S.Ct. 2360, 2367, 96 L.Ed.2d 222 (1987); Chaney, supra, 470 U.S., at 832, 105 S.Ct. at 1656 and whether review would have “disruptive practical consequences,” see Southern R. Co. v. Seaboard Allied Milling Corp., 442 U.S. 444, 457, 99 S.Ct. 2388, 2395, 60 L.Ed.2d 1017 (1979). This explains *610 the seeming contradiction between § 701(a)(2)’s disallowance of review to the extent that action is “committed to agency discretion,” and § 706’s injunction that a court shall set aside agency action that constitutes “an abuse of discretion.” Since, in the former provision, “committed to agency discretion by law” means “of the sort that is traditionally unreviewable,” it operates to keep certain categories of agency action out of the courts; but when agency action is appropriately in the courts, abuse of discretion is of course grounds for reversal.
 
All this law, shaped over the course of centuries and still developing in its application to new contexts, cannot possibly be contained within the phrase “no law to apply.” It is not surprising, then, that although the Court recites the test it does not really apply it. Like other opinions relying upon it, this one essentially announces the test, declares victory and moves on. It is not really true “ ‘that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion,’ ” ante, at 6, quoting Chaney, 470 U.S., at 830, 105 S.Ct., at 1655. The standard set forth in § 102(c) of the National Security Act of 1947, 50 U.S.C. § 403(c), “necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States,” at least excludes dismissal out of personal vindictiveness, or because the Director wants to give the job to his cousin. Why, on the Court’s theory, is respondent not entitled to assert the presence of such excesses, under the “abuse of discretion” standard of § 706?
 
If and when this Court does come to consider the reviewability of a dismissal such as the present one on the ground that it violated the agency’s regulations—a question the Court avoids today, see ante, at 2053, n. 7—the difference between the “no law to apply” test and what I consider the correct test will be crucial. Perhaps a dismissal in violation of the regulations can be reviewed, but not simply because the regulations provide a standard that makes review possible. Thus, I agree with the Court’s holding in Part II of its opinion *611 (though, as will soon appear, that holding seems to be undone by its holding in Part III), but on different reasoning.
 

II
Before taking the reader through the terrain of the Court’s holding that respondent **2058 may assert constitutional claims in this suit, I would like to try to clear some of the underbrush, consisting primarily of the Court’s ominous warning that “[a] ‘serious constitutional question’ ... would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim.” Ante, at 2053, quoting from Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 681, n. 12, 106 S.Ct. 2133, 2141–42, n. 12, 90 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986).
 
The first response to the Court’s grave doubt about the constitutionality of denying all judicial review to a “colorable constitutional claim” is that the denial of all judicial review is not at issue here, but merely the denial of review in United States district courts. As to that, the law is, and has long been, clear. Article III, § 2, of the Constitution extends the judicial power to “all Cases ... arising under this Constitution.” But Article III, § 1, provides that the judicial power shall be vested “in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish ” (emphasis added). We long ago held that the power not to create any lower federal courts at all includes the power to invest them with less than all of the judicial power.
“The Constitution has defined the limits of the judicial power of the United States, but has not prescribed how much of it shall be exercised by the Circuit Court; consequently, the statute which does prescribe the limits of their jurisdiction, cannot be in conflict with the Constitution, unless it confers powers not enumerated therein.” Sheldon v. Sill, 8 How. 441, 449, 12 L.Ed. 1147 (1850).
Thus, if there is any truth to the proposition that judicial cognizance of constitutional claims cannot be eliminated, it *612 is, at most, that they cannot be eliminated from state courts, and from this Court’s appellate jurisdiction over cases from state courts (or cases from federal courts, should there be any) involving such claims. Narrowly viewed, therefore, there is no shadow of a constitutional doubt that we are free to hold that the present suit, whether based on constitutional grounds or not, will not lie.
 
It can fairly be argued, however, that our interpretation of § 701(a)(2) indirectly implicates the constitutional question whether state courts can be deprived of jurisdiction, because if they cannot, then interpreting § 701(a)(2) to exclude relief here would impute to Congress the peculiar intent to let state courts review Federal Government action that it is unwilling to let federal district courts review—or, alternatively, the peculiar intent to let federal district courts review, upon removal from state courts pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1442(a)(1), claims that it is unwilling to let federal district courts review in original actions. I turn, then, to the substance of the Court’s warning that judicial review of all “colorable constitutional claims” arising out of the respondent’s dismissal may well be constitutionally required. What could possibly be the basis for this fear? Surely not some general principle that all constitutional violations must be remediable in the courts. The very text of the Constitution refutes that principle, since it provides that “[e]ach House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members,” Art. I, § 5, and that “for any Speech or Debate in either House, [the Senators and Representatives] shall not be questioned in any other Place,” Art. I, § 6. Claims concerning constitutional violations committed in these contexts—for example, the rather grave constitutional claim that an election has been stolen—cannot be addressed to the courts. See, e.g., Morgan v. United States, 255 U.S.App.D.C. 231, 801 F.2d 445 (1986). Even apart from the strict text of the Constitution, we have found some constitutional claims to be beyond judicial review because they involve *613 “political questions.” See, e.g., Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433, 443–446, 59 S.Ct. 972, 977–979, 83 L.Ed. 1385 (1939); **2059 Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metropolitan Park District, 281 U.S. 74, 79–80, 50 S.Ct. 228, 230–231, 74 L.Ed. 710 (1930). The doctrine of sovereign immunity—not repealed by the Constitution, but to the contrary at least partly reaffirmed as to the States by the Eleventh Amendment—is a monument to the principle that some constitutional claims can go unheard. No one would suggest that, if Congress had not passed the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1), the courts would be able to order disbursements from the Treasury to pay for property taken under lawful authority (and subsequently destroyed) without just compensation. See Schillinger v. United States, 155 U.S. 163, 166–169, 15 S.Ct. 85, 85–87, 39 L.Ed. 108 (1894). And finally, the doctrine of equitable discretion, which permits a court to refuse relief, even where no relief at law is available, when that would unduly impair the public interest, does not stand aside simply because the basis for the relief is a constitutional claim. In sum, it is simply untenable that there must be a judicial remedy for every constitutional violation. Members of Congress and the supervising officers of the Executive Branch take the same oath to uphold the Constitution that we do, and sometimes they are left to perform that oath unreviewed, as we always are.
 
Perhaps, then, the Court means to appeal to a more limited principle, that although there may be areas where judicial review of a constitutional claim will be denied, the scope of those areas is fixed by the Constitution and judicial tradition, and cannot be affected by Congress, through the enactment of a statute such as § 102(c). That would be a rather counter-intuitive principle, especially since Congress has in reality been the principal determiner of the scope of review, for constitutional claims as well as all other claims, through its waiver of the pre-existing doctrine of sovereign immunity. On the merits of the point, however: It seems to me clear that courts would not entertain, for example, an action for backpay by a dismissed Secretary of State claiming that the *614 reason he lost his Government job was that the President did not like his religious views—surely a colorable violation of the First Amendment. I am confident we would hold that the President’s choice of his Secretary of State is a “political question.” But what about a similar suit by the Deputy Secretary of State? Or one of the Under Secretaries? Or an Assistant Secretary? Or the head of the European Desk? Is there really a constitutional line that falls at some immutable point between one and another of these offices at which the principle of unreviewability cuts in, and which cannot be altered by congressional prescription? I think not. I think Congress can prescribe, at least within broad limits, that for certain jobs the dismissal decision will be unreviewable—that is, will be “committed to agency discretion by law.”
 
Once it is acknowledged, as I think it must be, (1) that not all constitutional claims require a judicial remedy, and (2) that the identification of those that do not can, even if only within narrow limits, be determined by Congress, then it is clear that the “serious constitutional question” feared by the Court is an illusion. Indeed, it seems to me that if one is in a mood to worry about serious constitutional questions the one to worry about is not whether Congress can, by enacting § 102(c), give the President, through his Director of Central Intelligence, unreviewable discretion in firing the agents that he employs to gather military and foreign affairs intelligence, but rather whether Congress could constitutionally permit the courts to review all such decisions if it wanted to. We have acknowledged that the courts cannot intervene when there is “a textually demonstratable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department.”  Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 217, 82 S.Ct. 691, 710, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962). We have recognized “the insistence (evident from the number of Clauses devoted to the subject) with which the Constitution confers authority over the Army, Navy, and militia upon the political branches.”   **2060 United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669, 682, 107 S.Ct. 3054, 3063, 97 L.Ed.2d 550 (1987). We have also recognized “the very delicate, plenary *615 and exclusive power of the President as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations—a power which does not require as a basis for its exercise an act of Congress.” United States v. Curtiss–Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 320, 57 S.Ct. 216, 221, 81 L.Ed. 255 (1936). And finally, we have acknowledged that “[i]t is impossible for a government wisely to make critical decisions about foreign policy and national defense without the benefit of dependable foreign intelligence.” Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 512, n. 7, 100 S.Ct. 763, 767 n. 7, 62 L.Ed.2d 704 (1980) (per curiam ). We have thus recognized that the “authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position in the Executive Branch that will give that person access to such information flows primarily from this constitutional investment of power in the President and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant.” Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. at 527, 108 S.Ct., at 824 (emphasis added).
 
I think it entirely beyond doubt that if Congress intended, by the APA in 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2), to exclude judicial review of the President’s decision (through the Director of Central Intelligence) to dismiss an officer of the Central Intelligence Agency, that disposition would be constitutionally permissible.
 

III
I turn, then, to whether that executive action is, within the meaning of § 701(a)(2), “committed to agency discretion by law.” My discussion of this point can be brief, because the answer is compellingly obvious. Section 102(c) of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 498, states:
“Notwithstanding ... the provisions of any other law, the Director of Central Intelligence, may, in his discretion, terminate the employment of any officer or employee of the Agency whenever he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the *616 United States....” 50 U.S.C. § 403(c) (emphasis added).
Further, as the Court declares, § 102(c) is an “integral part” of the National Security Act, which throughout exhibits “extraordinary deference to the Director.” Ante, at 2052–2053. Given this statutory text, and given (as discussed above) that the area to which the text pertains is one of predominant executive authority and of traditional judicial abstention, it is difficult to conceive of a statutory scheme that more clearly reflects that “commit[ment] to agency discretion by law” to which § 701(a)(2) refers.
 
It is baffling to observe that the Court seems to agree with the foregoing assessment, holding that “the language and structure of § 102(c) indicate that Congress meant to commit individual employee discharges to the Director’s discretion.” Ibid.. Nevertheless, without explanation the Court reaches the conclusion that “a constitutional claim based on an individual discharge may be reviewed by the District Court.” Ante, at 2054. It seems to me the Court is attempting the impossible feat of having its cake and eating it too. The opinion states that “[a] discharged employee ... cannot complain that his termination was not ‘necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States,’ since that assessment is the Director’s alone.” Ibid. (emphasis added). But two sentences later it says that “[n]othing in § 102(c) persuades us that Congress meant to preclude consideration of colorable constitutional claims arising out of the actions of the Director pursuant to that section.” Which are we to believe? If the former, the case should be at an end. If the § 102(c) assessment is really “the Director’s alone,” the only conceivable basis for review of respondent’s dismissal (which is what this case is about) would be that the dismissal was not really the result of a § 102(c) assessment by the Director. But respondent has never **2061 contended that, nor could he. Not only was his counsel formally advised, by letter of May 11, 1982, that “the Director has deemed it necessary and advisable in the interests of the United States to terminate your client’s employment with this Agency pursuant to section 102(c),” App. 37, but the petitioner filed with the court an affidavit by the Director, dated September 17, 1982, stating that “[a]fter careful consideration of the matter, I determined that the termination of Mr. Doe’s employment was necessary and *617 advisable in the interests of the United States and, exercising my discretion under the authority granted by section 102(c) ... I terminated Mr. Doe’s employment.” Id., at 56. Even if the basis for the Director’s assessment was the respondent’s homosexuality, and even if the connection between that and the interests of the United States is an irrational and hence an unconstitutional one, if that assessment is really “the Director’s alone” there is nothing more to litigate about. I cannot imagine what the Court expects the “further proceedings in the District Court” which it commands, ante, at 11, to consist of, unless perhaps an academic seminar on the relationship of homosexuality to security risk. For even were the District Court persuaded that no such relationship exists, “that assessment is the Director’s alone.”
 
Since the Court’s disposition contradicts its fair assurances, I must assume that the § 102(c) judgment is no longer “the Director’s alone,” but rather only “the Director’s alone except to the extent it is colorably claimed that his judgment is unconstitutional.” I turn, then, to the question of where this exception comes from. As discussed at length earlier, the Constitution assuredly does not require it. Nor does the text of the statute. True, it only gives the Director absolute discretion to dismiss “[n]otwithstanding ... the provisions of any other law ” (emphasis added). But one would hardly have expected it to say “[n]otwithstanding the provisions of any other law or of the Constitution.” What the provision directly addresses is the authority to dismiss, not the authority of the courts to review the dismissal. And the Director does not have the authority to dismiss in violation of the Constitution, nor could Congress give it to him. The implication *618 of nonreviewability in this text, its manifestation that the action is meant to be “committed to agency discretion,” is no weaker with regard to constitutional claims than nonconstitutional claims, unless one accepts the unacceptable proposition that the only basis for such committal is “no law to apply.”
 
Perhaps, then, a constitutional right is by its nature so much more important to the claimant than a statutory right that a statute which plainly excludes the latter should not be read to exclude the former unless it says so. That principle has never been announced—and with good reason, because its premise is not true. An individual’s contention that the Government has reneged upon a $100,000 debt owing under a contract is much more important to him—both financially and, I suspect, in the sense of injustice that he feels—than the same individual’s claim that a particular federal licensing provision requiring a $100 license denies him equal protection of the laws, or that a particular state tax violates the Commerce Clause. A citizen would much rather have his statutory entitlement correctly acknowledged after a constitutionally inadequate hearing, than have it incorrectly denied after a proceeding that fulfills all the requirements of the Due Process Clause. The only respect in which a constitutional claim is necessarily more significant than any other kind of claim is that, regardless of how trivial its real-life importance may be in the case at hand, it can be asserted against the action of the legislature itself, whereas a nonconstitutional claim (no matter how significant) cannot. That is an important distinction, and one relevant to the constitutional analysis that I conducted above. But it has no relevance to the question whether, as between executive violations of statute and executive violations of the Constitution—both of which **2062 are equally unlawful, and neither of which can be said, a priori, to be more harmful or more unfair to the plaintiff—one or the other category should be favored by a presumption against exclusion of judicial review.
 
*619 Even if we were to assume, however, contrary to all reason, that every constitutional claim is ipso facto more worthy, and every statutory claim less worthy, of judicial review, there would be no basis for writing that preference into a statute that makes no distinction between the two. We have rejected such judicial rewriting of legislation even in the more appealing situation where particular applications of a statute are not merely less desirable but in fact raise “grave constitutional doubts.” That, we have said, only permits us to adopt one rather than another permissible reading of the statute, but not, by altering its terms, “to ignore the legislative will in order to avoid constitutional adjudication.” Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 841, 106 S.Ct. 3245, 3252, 92 L.Ed.2d 675 (1986). There is no more textual basis for reading this statute as barring only nonconstitutional claims than there is to read it as barring only claims with a monetary worth of less than $1 million. Neither of the two decisions cited by the Court to sustain its power to read in a limitation for constitutional claims remotely supports that proposition. In Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974), we considered a statute precluding judicial review of “ ‘the decisions of the Administrator on any question of law or fact under any law administered by the Veterans’ Administration.’ ” Id., at 367, 94 S.Ct., at 1164 (quoting 38 U.S.C. § 211(a)). We concluded that this statute did not bar judicial review of a challenge to the constitutionality of the statute itself, since that was a challenge not to a decision of the Administrator but to a decision of Congress. Our holding was based upon the text, and not upon some judicial power to read in a “constitutional claims” exception. And in Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975), we held that 42 U.S.C. § 405(h), a statute depriving district courts of federal-question jurisdiction over “any claim arising under” Title II of the Social Security Act, did embrace even constitutional challenges, since its language was “quite different” from that at issue in Johnson, and “extend[ed] to any ‘action’ seeking ‘to recover on any [Social Security] claim’—irrespective *620 of whether resort to judicial processes is necessitated by ... allegedly unconstitutional statutory restrictions.” 422 U.S., at 762, 95 S.Ct., at 2465. In Salfi, to be sure, another statutory provision was available that would enable judicial review of the constitutional claim, but as just observed, that distinction does not justify drawing a line that has no basis in the statute. Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, supra.
 
The Court seeks to downplay the harm produced by today’s decision by observing that “petitioner acknowledges that Title VII claims attacking the hiring and promotion policies of the Agency are routinely entertained in federal court.” Ante, at 2054, citing Reply Brief for Petitioner 13–14; Tr. of Oral Arg. 9. Assuming that those suits are statutorily authorized, I am willing to accept the Director’s assertion that, while suits regarding hiring or promotion are tolerable, a suit regarding dismissal is not. Like the Court, I have no basis of knowledge on which I could deny that—especially since it is obvious that if the Director thinks that a particular hiring or promotion suit is genuinely contrary to the interests of the United States he can simply make the hiring or grant the promotion, and then dismiss the prospective litigant under § 102(c).
 
The harm done by today’s decision is that, contrary to what Congress knows is preferable, it brings a significant decision-making process of our intelligence services into a forum where it does not belong. Neither the Constitution, nor our laws, nor common sense gives an individual a right to come into court to litigate the reasons for **2063 his dismissal as an intelligence agent. It is of course not just valid constitutional claims that today’s decision makes the basis for judicial review of the Director’s action, but all colorable constitutional claims, whether meritorious or not. And in determining whether what is colorable is in fact meritorious, a court will necessarily have to review the entire decision. If the Director denies, for example, respondent’s contention in the present *621 case that he was dismissed because he was a homosexual, how can a court possibly resolve the dispute without knowing what other good, intelligence-related reasons there might have been? I do not see how any “latitude to control any discovery process,” ante, at 2054, could justify the refusal to permit such an inquiry, at least in camera. Presumably the court would be expected to evaluate whether the agent really did fail in this or that secret mission. The documents needed will make interesting reading for district judges (and perhaps others) throughout the country. Of course the Agency can seek to protect itself, ultimately, by an authorized assertion of executive privilege, United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974), but that is a power to be invoked only in extremis, and any scheme of judicial review of which it is a central feature is extreme. I would, in any event, not like to be the agent who has to explain to the intelligence services of other nations, with which we sometimes cooperate, that they need have no worry that the secret information they give us will be subjected to the notoriously broad discovery powers of our courts, because, although we have to litigate the dismissal of our spies, we have available a protection of somewhat uncertain scope known as executive privilege, which the President can invoke if he is willing to take the political damage that it often entails.
 
Today’s result, however, will have ramifications far beyond creation of the world’s only secret intelligence agency that must litigate the dismissal of its agents. If constitutional claims can be raised in this highly sensitive context, it is hard to imagine where they cannot. The assumption that there are any executive decisions that cannot be hauled into the courts may no longer be valid. Also obsolete may be the assumption that we are capable of preserving a sensible common law of judicial review.
 
I respectfully dissent.

Technically, this provision merely precludes judicial review under the judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), that is, under Chapter 7 of Title 5 of the United States Code. However, at least with respect to all entities that come within the Chapter's definition of “agency,” see 5 U.S.C. § 701(b), if review is not available under the APA it is not available at all. Chapter 7 (originally enacted as § 10 of the APA) is an umbrella statute governing judicial review of all federal agency action. While a right to judicial review of agency action may be created by a separate statutory or constitutional provision, once created it becomes subject to the judicial review provisions of the APA unless specifically excluded, see 5 U.S.C. § 559. To my knowledge, no specific exclusion exists.
