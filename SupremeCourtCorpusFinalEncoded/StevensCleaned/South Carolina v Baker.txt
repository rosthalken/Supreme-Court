
Although the Court properly finds support for its holding in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,     469 U.S. 528 (1985), the outcome of this case was equally clear well before that case was decided. See South Carolina v. Regan, 465 U.S. 367, 403-419 (1984) (STEVENS, J., concurring in     part and dissenting in part). It should be emphasized, however, that neither the Court's decision today, nor what I have written in the past, expresses any opinion about the wisdom of taxing the interest on bonds issued by state or local governments.
