Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor join, dissenting.

During the penalty phase of his capital murder trial, respondent Robert Woodall asked the court to instruct the jury not to draw any adverse inferences from his failure to testify. The court refused, and the Kentucky Supreme Court agreed that no instruction was warranted. The question before us is whether the Kentucky courts unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme [**710]  Court law in concluding that the Fifth Amendment did not entitle Woodall to a no-adverse-inference instruction. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). In my view, the answer is yes.



I
This Court’s decisions in Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U.S. 288, 101 S. Ct. 1112, 67 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1981), and Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 454, 101 S. Ct. 1866, 68 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1981), clearly establish that a criminal defendant is entitled to a requested no-adverse-inference instruction in the penalty phase of a capital trial. First consider Carter. The Court held  [***24] that a trial judge “has the constitutional obligation, upon proper request,” to give a requested no-adverse-inference instruction in order “to minimize the danger that the jury will give evidentiary weight to a defendant’s failure to testify.” 450 U.S., at 305, 101 S. Ct. 1112, 67 L. Ed. 2d 241. This is because when “the jury is left to roam at large with only its untutored instincts to guide it,” it may “draw from the defendant’s silence broad inferences of guilt.” Id., at 301, 101 S. Ct. 1112, 67 L. Ed. 2d 241. A trial court’s refusal to give a requested no-adverse-inference instruction thus “exacts an impermissible toll on the full and free exercise of the [Fifth Amendment] privilege.” Id., at 305, 101 S. Ct. 1112, 67 L. Ed. 2d 241.

Now consider Estelle. The Court held that “so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned,” it could “discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases” of a defendant’s “capital murder trial.” 451 U.S., at 462-463, 101 S. Ct. 1866, 68 L. Ed. 2d 359. The State had introduced at the penalty phase the defendant’s compelled statements to a psychiatrist, in order to show the defendant’s future dangerousness. Defending the admission of those statements, the State argued that the defendant “was not entitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment because  [***25] [his statements were] used only to determine punishment after conviction, not to establish guilt.” Id., at 462, 101 S. Ct. 1866, 68 L. Ed. 2d 359. This Court rejected the State’s argument on the ground that the Fifth Amendment applies equally to  [*1708]  the penalty phase and the guilt phase of a capital trial. Id., at 462-463, 101 S. Ct. 1866, 68 L. Ed. 2d 359.

What is unclear about the resulting law? If the Court holds in Case A that the First Amendment prohibits Congress from discriminating based on viewpoint, and then holds in Case B that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the First Amendment as to the States, then it is clear that the First Amendment prohibits the States from discriminating based on viewpoint. By the same logic, because the Court held in Carter that the Fifth Amendment requires a trial judge to give a requested no-adverse-inference instruction during the guilt phase of a trial, and held in Estelle that there is no basis for distinguishing between the guilt and punishment phases of a capital trial for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, it is clear that the Fifth Amendment requires a judge to provide a requested no-adverse-inference instruction during the penalty phase of a capital trial.



II
The Court avoids this logic by reading Estelle too  [***26] narrowly. First, it contends that Estelle’s holding that the Fifth Amendment applies equally to the guilt and penalty phases was mere dictum. Ante, at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1697, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 707, and n. 4. But this rule was [**711]  essential to the resolution of the case, so it is binding precedent, not dictum.

Second, apparently in the alternative, the majority acknowledges that Estelle “held that the privilege against self-incrimination applies to the penalty phase,” but it concludes that Estelle said nothing about the content of the privilege in the penalty phase. Ante, at ___, 134 S. Ct. 1697, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 705 (emphasis added). This interpretation of Estelle ignores its rationale. The reason that Estelle concluded that the Fifth Amendment applies to the penalty phase of a capital trial is that the Court saw “no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of [a defendant’s] capital murder trial so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned.” 451 U.S., at 462-463, 101 S. Ct. 1866, 68 L. Ed. 2d 359. And as there is no basis to distinguish between the two contexts for Fifth Amendment purposes, there is no basis for varying either the application or the content of the Fifth Amendment privilege in the two contexts.

The majority also reads our decision in Mitchell v. United States, 526 U.S. 314, 119 S. Ct. 1307, 143 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1999),  [***27] to change the legal landscape where it expressly declined to do so. In Mitchell, the Court considered whether to create an exception to the “normal rule in a criminal case . . . that no negative inference from the defendant’s failure to testify is permitted.” Id., at 328, 119 S. Ct. 1307, 143 L. Ed. 2d 424. We refused: “We decline to adopt an exception for the sentencing phase of a criminal case with regard to factual determinations respecting the circumstances and details of the crime.” Ibid. Mitchell thus reiterated what Carter and Estelle had already established. The “normal rule” is that Fifth Amendment protections apply during trial and sentencing. Because the Court refused “to adopt an exception” to this default rule, ibid. (emphasis added), the law before and after Mitchell remained the same.

The majority seizes upon the limited nature of Mitchell’s holding, concluding that by refusing to adopt an exception to the normal rule for certain “factual determinations,” Mitchell suggested that inferences about other matters might be permissible at the penalty phase. Ante, at ___ - ___, 134 S. Ct. 1697, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 705-706. The majority seems to believe that Mitchell somehow casts doubt upon whether Estelle’s Fifth Amendment rule applies to matters unrelated to  [***28] the “circumstances and details of the crime,”  [*1709]  such as remorse, or as to which the State does not bear the burden of proof.

As an initial matter, Mitchell would have had to overrule—or at least substantially limit — Estelle to create an exception for matters unrelated to the circumstances and details of the crime or for matters on which the defendant bears the burden of proof. Sentencing proceedings, particularly capital sentencing proceedings, often focus on factual matters that do not directly concern facts of the crime. Was the defendant subject to flagrant abuse in his growing-up years? Is he suffering from a severe physical or mental impairment? Was he supportive of his family? Is he remorseful? Estelle itself involved compelled statements introduced to establish the defendant’s future dangerousness—another fact often unrelated to the circumstances or details of a defendant’s crime. 451 U.S., at 456, 101 S. Ct. 1866, 68 L. Ed. 2d 359. In addition, States typically place the burden to prove mitigating factors at the penalty [**712]  phase on the defendant. A reasonable jurist would not believe that Mitchell, by refusing to create an exception to Estelle, intended to undermine the very case it reaffirmed.

Mitchell held, simply  [***29] and only, that the normal rule of Estelle applied in the circumstances of the particular case before the Court. That holding does not destabilize settled law beyond its reach. We frequently resist reaching beyond the facts of a case before us, and we often say so. That does not mean that we throw cases involving all other factual circumstances into a shadow-land of legal doubt.

The majority also places undue weight on dictum in Mitchell reserving judgment as to whether to create additional exceptions to the normal rule of Estelle and Carter. We noted: “Whether silence bears upon the determination of a lack of remorse, or upon acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward adjustment provided in § 3E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (1998), is a separate question. It is not before us, and we express no view on it.” 526 U.S., at 330, 119 S. Ct. 1307, 143 L. Ed. 2d 424. This dictum, says the majority, suggests that some inferences, including about remorse (which was at issue in Woodall’s case), may be permissible. Ante, at ___ - ___, 134 S. Ct. 1697, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 705-706.

When the Court merely reserves a question that is “not before us” for a future case, we do not cast doubt on legal principles that are already clearly established. The Court  [***30] often identifies questions that it is not answering in order to clarify the question it is answering. In so doing — that is, in “express[ing] no view” on questions that are not squarely before us—we do not create a state of uncertainty as to those questions. And in respect to Mitchell, where the Court reserved the question whether to create an exception to the normal rule, this is doubly true. The normal rule that a defendant is entitled to a requested no-adverse-inference instruction at the penalty phase as well as the guilt phase remained clearly established after Mitchell.



III
In holding that the Kentucky courts did not unreasonably apply clearly established law, the majority declares that if a court must “extend” the rationale of a case in order to apply it, the rationale is not clearly established. Ante, at ___ - ___, 134 S. Ct. 1697, 188 L. Ed. 2d, at 707-709. I read this to mean simply that if there may be “fairminded disagreement” about whether a rationale applies to a certain set of facts, a state court will not unreasonably apply the law by failing to apply that rationale, and I agree. See Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. ___, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624 (2011). I do not understand the majority to suggest that reading two  [*1710]  legal principles together would  [***31] necessarily “extend” the law, which would be a proposition entirely inconsistent with our case law. As long as fairminded jurists would conclude that two (or more) legal rules considered together would dictate a particular outcome, a state court unreasonably applies the law when it holds otherwise. Ibid.

That is the error the Kentucky Supreme Court committed here. Failing to consider together the legal principles established by Carter and Estelle, the state court confined those cases to their facts. It held that Carter did not apply because Woodall had already pleaded guilty—that is, because [**713]  Woodall requested a no-adverse-inference instruction at the penalty phase rather than the guilt phase of his trial. Woodall v. Commonwealth, 63 S.W. 3d 104, 115 (Ky. 2001). And it concluded that Estelle did not apply because Estelle was not a “jury instruction case.” 63 S.W. 3d, at 115. The Kentucky Supreme Court unreasonably failed to recognize that together Carter and Estelle compel a requested no-adverse-inference instruction at the penalty phase of a capital trial. And reading Mitchell to rein in the law in contemplation of never-before-recognized exceptions to this normal rule would be an  [***32] unreasonable retraction of clearly established law, not a proper failure to “extend” it. Because the Sixth Circuit correctly applied clearly established law in granting Woodall’s habeas petition, I would affirm.

With respect I dissent from the Court’s contrary conclusion.
