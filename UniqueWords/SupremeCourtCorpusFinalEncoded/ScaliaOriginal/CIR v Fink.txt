Supreme Court of the United States
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, Petitioner,
v.
Peter R. FINK, et ux.
No. 86-511.

Argued April 27, 1987.

Decided June 22, 1987.
 

Justice SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.
I do not believe that the Finks’ surrender of their shares was, or even closely resembles, a shareholder contribution to *101 corporate capital. Since, however, its purpose was to make the corporation a more valuable investment by giving it a more attractive capital structure, I think that it was, no less than a contribution to capital, an “amount paid out ... for ... betterments made to increase the value of ... property,” 26 U.S.C. § 263(a)(1), and thus not entitled to treatment as a current deduction.
