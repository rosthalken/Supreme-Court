No. 88-5126

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

488 U.S. 813

October 3, 1988

Justice Brennan, Justice Marshall and Justice Stevens, dissenting:  [*28]  For the reasons expressed in Brown v. Herald Co., Inc., 464 U.S. 928 (1983), we would dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction and, treating the papers whereon the appeal would be taken as a petition for writ of certiorari, deny the petition for a writ of certiorari without reaching the merits of the motion to proceed in forma pauperis.
