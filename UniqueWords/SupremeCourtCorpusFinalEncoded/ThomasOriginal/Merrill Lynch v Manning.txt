SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

136 S. Ct. 1562

December 1, 2015, Argued 
May 16, 2016, Decided

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Sotomayor joins, concurring in the judgment.
The Court concludes that respondents’ suit belongs in state court because it does not satisfy the multifactor, atextual standard that we have used to assess whether a suit is one “arising under” federal law, 28 U. S. C. §1331. Ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 689. I agree that this suit belongs in state court, but I would rest that conclusion on the statute before us, §27 of the Securities Exchange  [*1576]  Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. §78aa. That statute does not use the phrase “arising under” or provide a sound basis for adopting the arising-under standard. It instead provides federal jurisdiction where a suit is “brought to enforce” Exchange Act requirements. §78aa(a). That language establishes a straightforward test: If a complaint alleges a claim that necessarily depends on a breach of a requirement created by the Act, §27 confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over that suit. Because the complaint here does not allege such claims—and because no other statute confers federal jurisdiction—this [**690]  suit should return to state court.    Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.
I
A
Section 27 provides that “[t]he district courts . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction . . . of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder.” §78aa(a). * As the Court explains, under a “natural reading,” §27 “confers federal jurisdiction when an action is commenced in order to give effect to an Exchange Act requirement.” Ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 681; see also Webster’s New International Dictionary of the English Language 725 (1927) (“enforce” means “give force to” or “give effect to”). And by providing “exclusive jurisdiction” to federal district courts over certain suits, §27 strips state courts of jurisdiction over such suits.
Put differently, under §27 a suit belongs in federal court when the complaint requires a court to enforce an Exchange Act duty or liability. In contrast, a suit belongs in state court when the complaint “assert[s] purely state-law    causes of action” that do not require “binding legal determinations of rights and liabilities under the Exchange Act” or “a judgment on the merits of” an Exchange Act breach. Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516 U. S. 367, 382, 384, 116 S. Ct. 873, 134 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1996). Such a suit is “not ‘brought to enforce’ any rights or obligations under the Act,” and thus does not fall within §27’s scope. Id., at 381, 116 S. Ct. 873, 134 L. Ed. 2d 6. So §27 does not provide federal jurisdiction over suits brought to enforce liabilities or duties under state law or over every case that happens to involve allegations that the Act was violated. The provision leaves state courts with some authority over suits involving the Act or its regulations.
The statutory context bolsters this understanding. That context confirms that Congress reserved some authority to state courts to adjudicate securities-law matters. Although the Act provides numerous federal “rights and remedies,” it also generally preserves “all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity,” such as claims that could be litigated in state courts of general jurisdiction. 15 U. S. C. §78bb(a)(2). That provision shows that “Congress plainly contemplated the possibility of dual litigation in state and federal courts relating to securities transactions.” Matsushita, supra, at 383, 116 S. Ct. 873, 134 L. Ed. 2d 6. A natural reading    of §27’s text preserves the dual role for federal and state courts that Congress contemplated, and it confirms that mere allegations of Exchange Act breaches do not alone deprive state courts of jurisdiction.
A natural reading promotes the uniform interpretation of the federal securities laws  [*1577]  that Congress sought to ensure when it gave federal courts “exclusive jurisdiction” over federal securities-law suits. §78aa(a). The textual approach fosters uniformity because it leaves to federal courts—which are presumptively more familiar  [**691]  with the intricate federal securities laws—the task of “adjudicat[ing] . . . Exchange Act claims.” Matsushita, 516 U. S., at 383, 116 S. Ct. 873, 134 L. Ed. 2d 6. When state courts decide cases where the complaint pleads only state-law claims and do not resolve the merits of Exchange Act rights or liabilities, they are not “trespass[ing] upon the exclusive territory of the federal courts.” Id., at 382, 116 S. Ct. 873, 134 L. Ed. 2d 6.
The statutory text and structure thus support a straightforward test: Section 27 confers federal jurisdiction over a case if the complaint alleges claims that necessarily depend on establishing a breach of an Exchange Act requirement.
B
The Third Circuit was correct to remand this suit to state court. Respondents’ complaint does not seek “to enforce any liability or duty created    by” the Exchange Act or its regulations. §78aa(a).
Although respondents’ complaint alleges at different places that petitioners violated the Exchange Act or its regulations, the complaint does not bring claims requiring enforcement of the Exchange Act or its regulations. The complaint instead brings 10 state-law causes of action that seek to enforce duties and liabilities created by state law. Count 2 alleges that petitioners violated state law by investing money derived from racketeering. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 91a-93a, Amended Complaint ¶¶114-122 (citing N. J. Stat. Ann. §2C:41-2a (West 2005)). Counts 3 through 9 allege standard state-law contract and tort claims: unjust enrichment, unlawful interference with economic advantage, tortious interference with contractual relations, unlawful interference with contractual relations, third-party-beneficiary claims, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and negligence. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 93a-101a, Amended Complaint ¶¶123-158. Count 10 pleads a freestanding claim for punitive and exemplary damages. See id., at 101a, Amended Complaint ¶¶159-161. None of these claims requires a court to “enforce”—to give effect to—a requirement created by the Act, thus,    §27 does not confer federal jurisdiction over them.
Count 1 presents a closer call, but it too does not trigger federal jurisdiction. That count pleads that petitioners violated a state law that makes it unlawful for a person to participate in a racketeering enterprise. Id., at 82a-90a, Amended Complaint ¶¶88-113 (citing N. J. Stat. Ann. §2C:41-2c). The alleged racketeering includes violating the New Jersey Uniform Securities Law (through fraud, deception, and misappropriation), committing “theft by taking” under state law, and committing “theft by deception” under state law. App. to Pet. for Cert. 82a-90a, Amended Complaint ¶¶88-113. Respondents allege that “[t]he SEC has expressly noted that naked short selling involves the omission of a material fact” as part of their state-law securities fraud allegation. Id., at 85a, Amended Complaint ¶100. Vindicating that claim would not require the enforcement of a federal duty or liability. New Jersey law encompasses fraudulent conduct that does not necessarily rest on a violation of federal law or regulation. See, e.g., §49:3-49(e)(1) (West 2001) (fraud and deceit include “[a]ny misrepresentation by word, conduct or in any manner of  [**692]  any material fact, either present or past, and any omission to disclose any    such fact”); see App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a-86a (invoking §49:3-49 et seq.). So although Count  [*1578]  1 refers to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s view about naked short selling, that count does not require respondents to establish a violation of federal securities law to prevail on their fraud claim. Because respondents’ cause of action in Count 1 seeks to enforce duties and liabilities created by state law and does not necessarily depend on the breach of an Exchange Act duty or liability, §27 does not provide federal jurisdiction over that claim.
II
Although the Court acknowledges the “natural reading” of §27, ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 681, it holds that §27 adopts the jurisdictional test that this Court uses to evaluate federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. §1331. See ante, at ___ - ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 683-684; see also ante, at ___ - ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 684-689. Federal courts have the power to review cases “arising under” federal law, §1331, including those in which the complaint brings state-law claims that “necessarily raise a stated federal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.” Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, 314, 125 S. Ct. 2363, 162 L. Ed. 2d 257 (2005). The Court wrongly equates the phrase “arising under” in §1331 with the    phrase “brought to enforce” in §27, and interprets the latter to require that a case raising state-law claims “mee[t] the ‘arising under’ standard” for that case to proceed in federal court. Ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 682; see ante, at ___ - ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 682-683. None of the Court’s rationales for adopting that rule is persuasive.
A
The Court first argues that “it is impossible to infer that Congress, in enacting §27, wished to depart from what we now understand as the ‘arising under’ standard” because there was no “well-defined test” to depart from. Ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 684. The Court’s case law construing §1331, the Court explains, “was for many decades—including when the Exchange Act passed—highly unruly.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).
But when Congress enacts a statute that uses different language from a prior statute, we normally presume that Congress did so to convey a different meaning. See, e.g., Crawford v. Burke, 195 U. S. 176, 190, 25 S. Ct. 9, 49 L. Ed. 147 (1904) (explaining that “a change in phraseology creates a presumption of a change in intent” and that “Congress would not have used such different language [in two statutes] without thereby intending a change of meaning”). Given what we know about §1331, that presumption has force here. Our §1331 case law was, as the Court notes, “highly unruly” when the Exchange Act    was enacted in 1934. Given the importance of clarity in jurisdictional statutes, see Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S. 77, 94, 130 S. Ct. 1181, 175 L. Ed. 2d 1029 (2010), it is quite a stretch to infer that Congress wished to embrace such an unpredictable test.
That is especially true given that §27 does not use words supporting  [**693]  the convoluted arising-under standard. Section 27 does not ask (for example) whether a federal issue is substantial or whether a ruling on that issue will upset the congressionally approved balance of federal and state power. Indeed, §1331 itself does not even use words supporting the arising-under standard. See ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 684 (acknowledging that the arising-under standard “does not turn on §1331’s text”). Rather, the Court has refused to give full effect to §1331’s “broa[d] phras[ing]” and has instead “continuously construed and  [*1579]  limited” that provision based on extratextual considerations, such as “history,” “the demands of reason and coherence,” and “sound judicial policy.” Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 379, 79 S. Ct. 468, 3 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1959). Faced with a plain and focused text like §27, however, we should not rely on such considerations. And importing factors from our §1331 arising-under jurisprudence—such as a substantiality requirement and a federal-state balance requirement—risks narrowing the class of cases that Congress meant to cover with §27’s plain text.    For these reasons, it is unwise to read into §27 a decision to adopt the arising-under standard.
B
The Court next relies on two prior decisions—Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court of Del. for New Castle Cty., 366 U. S. 656, 81 S. Ct. 1303, 6 L. Ed. 2d 584 (1961), and Matsushita, 516 U. S. 367, 116 S. Ct. 873, 134 L. Ed. 2d 6. See ante, at ___ - ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 684-686. Neither case justifies the Court’s decision to apply the arising-under standard to §27.
In Pan American, the Court held that Delaware state courts had jurisdiction over state-law contract claims that arose from contracts for the sale of natural gas. 366 U. S., at 662-665, 81 S. Ct. 1303, 6 L. Ed. 2d 584. The Court reached that decision even though a provision of the Natural Gas Act provided exclusive federal jurisdiction over suits “‘brought to enforce any liability or duty created by’” that Act. Id., at 662, 81 S. Ct. 1303, 6 L. Ed. 2d 584 (quoting statute). Pan American lends some support to the Court’s view today. It applied the Court’s arising-under precedents and “explained that [the Natural Gas Act’s] use of the term ‘brought to enforce,’ rather than ‘arising under,’ made no difference to the jurisdictional analysis.” Ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 684; see Pan American, supra, at 665, n. 2, 81 S. Ct. 1303, 6 L. Ed. 2d 584; see also ante, at ___ - ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 684-686.
But Pan American does not require the Court to engraft the arising-under standard onto §27. Pan American did not carefully analyze the Natural Gas Act’s text or assess the contemporary meaning of the central phrase “brought to enforce.” Instead,    the Court relied on legislative history, reasoning that “authoritative [congressional] Committee Reports” implied a limitation on the Natural Gas Act’s jurisdictional text. 366 U. S., at 665, n. 2, 81 S. Ct. 1303, 6 L. Ed. 2d 584. That reasoning does not warrant our respect. That is especially true because Pan American’s holding is consistent with the Natural Gas Act’s “brought to enforce” language. The complaint in that case did not “asser[t]” any “right . . . under the Natural Gas Act” and instead asked the court to adjudicate standard state-law [**694]  “contract or quasi-contract” claims. Id., at 663, 664, 81 S. Ct. 1303, 6 L. Ed. 2d 584. The Court’s disposition in Pan American rests as comfortably on the statutory text as it does on the arising-under standard.
Matsushita provides even less support for the Court’s holding today. In that case the Court held that Delaware courts could issue a judgment approving a settlement releasing securities-law claims even though the settlement released claims that were (by virtue of §27) “solely within the jurisdiction of the federal courts.” 516 U. S., at 375, 116 S. Ct. 873, 134 L. Ed. 2d 6; see id., at 370-372, 116 S. Ct. 873, 134 L. Ed. 2d 6. The Court explained that, “[w]hile §27 prohibits state courts from adjudicating claims arising under the Exchange Act, it does not prohibit state courts from approving the release of Exchange Act claims in the settlement of suits    over which they have properly exercised jurisdiction, i.e., suits arising under state law or under federal law for which there is concurrent jurisdiction.” Id., at 381, 116 S. Ct. 873, 134 L. Ed. 2d 6. Because the complaint  [*1580]  in that case “assert[ed] purely state-law causes of action” and the state courts did not issue “a judgment on the merits of the [exclusively federal] claims,” §27 did not deprive state courts of jurisdiction. Id., at 382, 116 S. Ct. 873, 134 L. Ed. 2d 6.
The Court relies on Matsushita because in that case we three times “described” §27 “as conferring exclusive jurisdiction of suits ‘arising under’ the Exchange Act.” Ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 686 (citing 516 U. S., at 380, 381, 385, 116 S. Ct. 873, 134 L. Ed. 2d 6). But Matsushita did not decide whether §27 adopts the arising-under standard, so its passing use of the phrase “arising under” cannot bear the weight that the Court now places on it. To be sure, Matsushita does support the Court’s judgment today: Matsushita emphasized that state courts could adjudicate a suit involving securities-law issues where the complaint “assert[ed] purely state-law causes of action” and did not require the state courts to issue “binding legal determinations of rights and liabilities under the Exchange Act” or “a judgment on the merits of” an Exchange Act breach. Id., at 382, 384, 116 S. Ct. 873, 134 L. Ed. 2d 6. But those statements are more consistent with §27’s text    than they are with the arising-under standard. See supra, at ___ - ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 690-691 (invoking Matsushita).
C
Finally, the Court argues that its interpretation “serves the goals” that our precedents have “consistently underscored in interpreting jurisdictional statutes”—affording proper deference to state courts and promoting administrable jurisdictional rules. Ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 686; see ante, at ___ - ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 686-689. But hewing to §27’s text serves these goals as well as or better than does adopting the arising-under standard.
First, the text-based view preserves state courts’ authority to adjudicate numerous securities-law claims and provide relief consistent with the Exchange Act’s design. See supra, at ___ - ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 690-691. As explained above, that view places all of respondents’ state-law causes of action in state court. See supra, at ___ - ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 691-692. The text-based view thus “decline[s]  [**695]  to construe [a] federal jurisdictional statut[e] more expansively than [its] language, most fairly read, requires.” Ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 686.
Second, the textual test is also more administrable than the arising-under standard. The arising-under standard “is anything but clear.” Grable, 545 U. S., at 321, 125 S. Ct. 2363, 162 L. Ed. 2d 257 (THOMAS, J., concurring). The standard involves numerous judgments about matters of degree that are not readily susceptible to bright lines. As noted, to satisfy that    standard, a state-law claim must raise a federal issue that is (among other things) “actually disputed,” is “substantial,” and will not “distur[b]” a congressionally approved federal-state “balance.” Id., at 314, 125 S. Ct. 2363, 162 L. Ed. 2d 257 (opinion of Court). The standard “calls for a ‘common-sense accommodation of judgment to [the] kaleidoscopic situations’ that present a federal issue, in ‘a selective process which picks the substantial causes out of the web and lays the other ones aside.’” Id., at 313, 125 S. Ct. 2363, 162 L. Ed. 2d 257 (quoting Gully v. First Nat. Bank in Meridian, 299 U. S. 109, 117-118, 57 S. Ct. 96, 81 L. Ed. 70 (1936)). The arising-under standard may be many things, but it is not one that consistently “provides ready answers” to hard jurisdictional questions. Ante, at ___, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 688. The text-based view promises better. I would adopt that view and apply it here.
***
For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.
 
* * As the Court explains, the parties have not pressed us to construe §27’s language conferring jurisdiction over “violations” of the Exchange Act, its rules, or its regulations. See ante, at ___, n. 2, 194 L. Ed. 2d, at 681. Like the Court, I focus on §27’s “brought to enforce” language.
