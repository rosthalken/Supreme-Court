RILEY, DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF THE TENTH PROSECUTORIAL DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA, ET AL. v. NATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND OF NORTH CAROLINA, INC., ET AL.

No. 87-328

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

487 U.S. 781

March 23, 1988, Argued 
June 29, 1988, Decided

JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
Although I join Parts I, II, and III of the Court's opinion, I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that the licensing provisions in  [**2682]  the North Carolina statute do not impose a significant burden on the charities' ability to speak and that there is no evidence suggesting that the State will be dilatory in the processing of license applications. Thus, I respectfully dissent from Part IV of the Court's opinion.
