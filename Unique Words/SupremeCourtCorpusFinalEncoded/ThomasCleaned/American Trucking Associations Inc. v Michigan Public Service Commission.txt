I would affirm the judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals because "'[t]he negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the text of the Constitution, makes little sense, and has proved virtually unworkable in application,' Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U.S. 564, 610, 137 L. Ed. 2d 852, 117 S. Ct. 1590 (1997) (Thomas, J., dissenting), and, consequently, cannot serve as a basis for striking down a state statute." Hillside Dairy Inc. v. Lyons, 539 U.S. 59, 68, 156 L. Ed. 2d 54, 123 S. Ct. 2142 (2003) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).
