FRANK, POSTMASTER GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, ET AL. v. MINNESOTA NEWSPAPER ASSOCIATION, INC.

No. 87-1956

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

490 U.S. 225

March 22, 1989, Argued 
April 25, 1989, Decided

JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
In my opinion appellants' concession is a reason for affirming, rather than vacating, the judgment of the District Court insofar as it enjoins the Postmaster General from enforcing 18 U. S. C. § 1302 as applied to prize lists. I therefore respectfully dissent.
