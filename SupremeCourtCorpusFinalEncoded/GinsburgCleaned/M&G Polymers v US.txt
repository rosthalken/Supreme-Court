
Today’s decision rightly holds that courts must apply ordinary contract principles, shorn of presumptions, to determine whether retiree health-care benefits survive the expiration of a collective-bargaining agreement. Under the “cardinal principle” of contract interpretation, “the intention of the parties, to be gathered from the whole instrument, must prevail.” 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §30:2, p. 27 (4th ed. 2012) (Williston). To determine what the contracting parties intended, a court must examine the entire agreement in light of relevant industry-specific     “customs, practices, usages, and terminology.” Id., §30:4, at 55-58. When the intent of the parties is unambiguously expressed in the contract, that expression controls, and the court’s    inquiry should proceed no further. Id., §30:6, at 98-104. But when the contract is ambiguous, a court may consider extrinsic evidence to determine the intentions of the parties. Id., §30:7, at 116-124.

Contrary to M&G’s assertion, Brief for Petitioner 25, no rule requires “clear and express” language in order to show that parties intended health-care benefits to vest. “[C]onstraints upon the employer after the expiration date of a collective-bargaining agreement,” we have observed, may be derived from the agreement’s “explicit terms,” but they “may arise as well from . . . implied terms of the expired agreement.” Litton Financial Printing Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U.S. 190, 203, 207, 111 S. Ct. 2215, 115 L. Ed. 2d 177 (1991).

On remand, the Court of Appeals should examine the entire agreement to determine whether the parties intended retiree health-care benefits to vest. 11 Williston §30:4, at 55-57. Because the retirees have a vested, lifetime right to a monthly pension, App. 366, a provision stating that retirees “will receive” health-care benefits if they are “receiving a monthly pension” is relevant to this examination. Id., at 415. So is a “survivor benefits” clause instructing that if a retiree dies, her surviving spouse will “continue to receive [the retiree’s health-care] benefits . . . until death or remarriage.” Id., at 417. If,    after considering all relevant contractual language in light of industry practices, the Court of Appeals concludes that the contract is ambiguous, it may     turn to extrinsic evidence—for example, the parties’ bargaining history. The Court of Appeals, however, must conduct the foregoing inspection without Yard-Man’s “thumb on the scale in favor of vested retiree benefits.” Ante, at 10; see International Union, United Auto, Aerospace, & Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v. Yard-Man, Inc., 716 F. 2d 1476 (1983).

Because I understand the Court’s opinion to be consistent with these basic rules of contract interpretation, I join it.
