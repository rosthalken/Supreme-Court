JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.

Because the Court has not yet held that the rule of United States v. Leon, ante, p. 897, has any application to warrantless searches, I do not join the portion of JUSTICE WHITE's opinion that relies on that case. I do, however, agree with the remainder of his dissenting opinion.
