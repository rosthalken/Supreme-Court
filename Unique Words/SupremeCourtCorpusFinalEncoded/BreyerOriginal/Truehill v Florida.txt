Justice Breyer, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.

In part for the reasons set forth in my opinion in Hurst v. Florida, 577 U. S. __, __, 136 S. Ct. 616, 193 L. Ed. 2d 504 (2016) (concurring opinion in judgment), I would vacate and remand for the Florida Supreme Court to address the Eighth Amendment issue in these cases. I therefore join the dissenting opinion of Justice Sotomayor in full.
