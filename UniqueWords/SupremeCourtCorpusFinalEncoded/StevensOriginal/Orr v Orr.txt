MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.
Whether Mr. Orr has a continuing contractual obligation to pay alimony to Mrs. Orr is a question of Alabama law that the Alabama courts have not yet decided. In Part I-B of his opinion, MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST seems to be making one of two alternative suggestions:

(1) that we should decide the state-law issue; or

 [*285]  (2) that we should direct the Supreme Court of Alabama to decide that issue before deciding the federal constitutional issue.

 [**1115]  In my judgment the Court has correctly rejected both of these alternatives. To accept either -- or a rather confused blend of the two -- would violate principles of federalism that transcend the significance  [****29]   [***323]  of this case. *Link to the text of the note I therefore join the Court's opinion.

Even if I could agree with MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST's view that Mr. Orr's probability of success on the state-law issue is so remote that we should deny him standing to argue the federal question decided by the Alabama Supreme Court, I still would not understand how he reached the conclusion that the litigation between Mr. and Mrs. Orr is not a "case or controversy" within the meaning of Art. III.
