Supreme Court of the United States
Jeffrey MAREK, Thomas Wadycki and Lawrence Rhode, Petitioners
v.
Alfred W. CHESNY, Individually and as Administrator of the Estate of Steven Chesny, Deceased.
No. 83–1437.
|
Argued Dec. 5, 1984.
|
Decided June 27, 1985.
 

Justice REHNQUIST, concurring.
In Delta Airlines, Inc. v. August, 450 U.S. 346, 101 S.Ct. 1146, 67 L.Ed.2d 287 (1981), I expressed in dissent the view that the term “costs” in Rule 68 did not include attorney’s fees. Further examination of the question has convinced me that this view was wrong, and I therefore join the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE. Cf. McGrath v. Kristensen, 340 U.S. 162, 176, 71 S.Ct. 224, 232, 95 L.Ed. 173 (1950) (Jackson, J. concurring).
