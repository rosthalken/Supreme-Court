Juan Velazquez, Petitioner v. Arizona.

No. 07-8946.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

553 U.S. 1014

April 21, 2008, Decided

Statement of JUSTICE STEVENS respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari.
While I agree with the Court's decision to deny certiorari in this case, it is appropriate to emphasize, as I have in the past, see, e.g., Knight v. Florida, 528 U.S. 990, 120 S. Ct. 459, 145 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1999) (opinion respecting denial of certiorari); Singleton v. Commissioner, 439 U.S. 940, 942, 99 S. Ct. 335, 58 L. Ed. 2d 335  [*1015]  (1978) (same), that the denial of certiorari expresses no opinion on the merits of the underlying claim.
