Bolley JOHNSON, Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, et al.
UNITED STATES, Appellant,
v.
FLORIDA, et al.
Nos. 92–519, 92–593 and 92–767.

Argued Oct. 4, 1993.
|
Decided June 30, 1994.
Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice SCALIA joins, dissenting.

For the reasons I explain in Holder v. Hall, 512 U.S. 874, 891, 114 S.Ct. 2581, 129 L.Ed.2d 687 (1994), I would vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand with instructions to dismiss the actions consolidated in these cases for failure to state a claim under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 42 U.S.C. § 1973. Each of the actions consolidated in these cases asserted that Florida’s apportionment plan diluted the vote of a minority group. In accordance *1032 with the views I express in Holder, I would hold that an apportionment plan is not a “standard, practice, or procedure” that may be challenged under § 2. I therefore respectfully dissent.
