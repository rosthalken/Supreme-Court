
In light of the Court's decision to apply a uniform characterization for limitations purposes to actions arising under 42 U. S. C. § 1981, I agree that the most appropriate choice is each State's limitations period for personal injury suits. But see Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 280-287 (1985) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). Although I doubt whether the Court's decision should be given general retroactive effect, I agree that the Court should adhere to its policy of applying the rule     it announces to the parties before the Court. See Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 301 (1967). I therefore concur in the judgment of the Court in No. 85-1626. I join Parts I through IV of JUSTICE POWELL's opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, as to No. 85-2010.
