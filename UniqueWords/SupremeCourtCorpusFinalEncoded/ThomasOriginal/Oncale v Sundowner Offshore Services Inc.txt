Supreme Court of the United States
Joseph ONCALE, Petitioner,
v.
SUNDOWNER OFFSHORE SERVICES, INCORPORATED, et al.
No. 96–568.
|
Argued Dec. 3, 1997.
|
Decided March 4, 1998.
 

Justice THOMAS, concurring.

I concur because the Court stresses that in every sexual harassment case, the plaintiff must plead and ultimately prove Title VII’s statutory requirement that there be discrimination “because of ... sex.”
