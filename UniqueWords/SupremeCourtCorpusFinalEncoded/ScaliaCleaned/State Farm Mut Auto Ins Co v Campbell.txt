
I adhere to the view expressed in my dissenting opinion in BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 598–99, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996), that the Due Process Clause provides no substantive protections against “excessive” or “ ‘unreasonable’ ” awards of punitive damages. I am also of the view that the punitive damages jurisprudence which has sprung forth from BMW v. Gore is insusceptible of principled application; accordingly, I do not feel justified in giving the case stare decisis effect. See id., at 599, 116 S.Ct. 1589. I would affirm the judgment of the Utah Supreme Court.

By switching the focus from the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages to the potential loss to the plaintiffs had the defendant succeeded in its illicit scheme, the Court could describe the relevant ratio in TXO as 10 to 1. See BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 581, and n. 34, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996).

TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U.S. 443, 462, n. 8, 113 S.Ct. 2711, 125 L.Ed.2d 366 (1993), noted that “[u]nder well-settled law,” a defendant's “wrongdoing in other parts of the country” and its “impressive net worth” are factors “typically considered in assessing punitive damages.” It remains to be seen whether, or the extent to which, today's decision will unsettle that law.
