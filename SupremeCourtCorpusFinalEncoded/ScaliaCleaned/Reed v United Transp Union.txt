
I remain of the view that the Court should apply the appropriate state statute of limitations (if any at all) when a federal statute lacks an explicit limitations period. See Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley–Duff & Associates, Inc., 483 U.S. 143, 170, 107 S.Ct. 2759, 2774, 97 L.Ed.2d 121 (1987) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.
