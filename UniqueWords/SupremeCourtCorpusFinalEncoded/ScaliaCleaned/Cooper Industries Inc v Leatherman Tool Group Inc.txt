
I was (and remain) of the view that excessive punitive damages do not violate the Due Process Clause; but the Court held otherwise. See BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996); id., at 598, 116 S.Ct. 1589 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). And I was of the view that we should review for abuse *444 of discretion (rather than de novo ) fact-bound constitutional issues which, in their resistance to meaningful generalization, resemble the question of excessiveness of punitive damages—namely, whether there exists reasonable suspicion for a stop and probable cause for a search; but the Court held otherwise. See Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); id., at 700, 116 S.Ct. 1657 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Finally, in a case in which I joined a dissent that made it unnecessary for me to reach the issue, the Court categorically stated that “the question whether a fine is constitutionally excessive calls for ... de novo review.” United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 336–337, n. 10, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998); see id., at 344, 118 S.Ct. 2028 (KENNEDY, J., joined by REHNQUIST, C. J., and O’CONNOR and SCALIA, JJ., dissenting). Given these precedents, I **1690 agree that de novo review of the question of excessive punitive damages best accords with our jurisprudence. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.
