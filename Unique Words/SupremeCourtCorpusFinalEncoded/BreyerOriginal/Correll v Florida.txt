JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting from denial of certiorari and application for stay of execution.

Jerry William Correll was sentenced to death on February 7, 1986, and has now been incarcerated on death row by the State of Florida for over 29 years. Correll requests a stay of execution to allow the Court to consider his claims that Florida’s sentencing procedures violate the Sixth and Eighth Amendments and that his lengthy period of incarceration under threat of execution constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.

I remain convinced that the Court should consider whether nearly 30 years of incarceration under sentence of death is cruel and unusual punishment. See Lackey v. Texas, 514 U. S. 1045, 115 S. Ct. 1421, 131 L. Ed. 2d 304 (1995) (Stevens, J., memorandum respecting denial of certiorari); Knight v. Florida, 528 U. S. 990, 993, 120 S. Ct. 459, 145 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1999) (BREYER, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); see also Glossip v. Gross, 576 U. S. ___, ___, 135 S. Ct. 2726, 192 L. Ed. 2d 761, 793-841 (2015) (BREYER, J., dissenting).

In addition, whether Florida’s sentencing procedures violate [**2]  the Sixth and Eighth Amendments is now pending before the Court. Hurst v. Florida, ___ U.S. ___, 135 S. Ct. 1531; 191 L. Ed. 2d 558. In my view, we should hold this petition for resolution of those issues in Hurst.

I respectfully dissent from the order of the Court to deny the application for stay of execution and the petition for a writ of certiorari.
