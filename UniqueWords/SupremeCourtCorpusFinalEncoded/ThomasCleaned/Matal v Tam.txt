I join the opinion of Justice Alito, except for Part II. Respondent failed to present his statutory argument either to the Patent and Trademark Office or to the Court of Appeals, and we declined respondent’s invitation to grant certiorari on this question. Ante, at ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 378. I see no reason to address this legal question in the first instance. See Star Athletica, L. L. C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U.S. ___, ___, 137 S. Ct. 1002; 197 L. Ed. 2d 354, 356 (2017).
I also write separately because “I continue to believe that when the government seeks to restrict truthful speech in order to suppress the ideas it conveys, strict scrutiny is appropriate, whether or not the speech in question may be characterized as     ‘commercial.’” Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525, 572, 121 S. Ct. 2404, 150 L. Ed. 2d 532 (2001) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also, e.g., 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 518, 116 S. Ct. 1495, 134 L. Ed. 2d 711 (1996) (same). I nonetheless join    Part IV of Justice Alito’s opinion because it correctly concludes that the disparagement clause, 15 U.S.C. §1052(a), is unconstitutional even under the less stringent test announced in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp., 447 U.S. 557, 100 S. Ct. 2343, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1980).
