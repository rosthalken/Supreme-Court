JUSTICE O'CONNOR, dissenting.

I join Parts I, II, and III of JUSTICE MARSHALL's dissent. They accurately demonstrate that the Court's interpretation of § 301(l) of the Clean  [***123]  Water Act, 33 U. S. C. § 1311(l), is inconsistent with the language of the statute and its legislative history. In my opinion, this alone is sufficient  [**1128]  grounds for affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I express no view as to Part IV of the dissent because I think it is not necessary to the disposition [****82]  of these cases.
