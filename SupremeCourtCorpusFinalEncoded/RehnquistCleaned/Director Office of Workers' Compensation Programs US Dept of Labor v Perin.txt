
At the time of his injury, Churchill was engaged in unloading materials from a supply barge to a cargo barge. This work is very much like the work of longshoremen, who typically load and unload vessels. Therefore Churchill was “engaged in maritime employment” within the meaning of § 2(3) the Act, and was within its coverage. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.
