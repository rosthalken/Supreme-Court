Supreme Court of the United States
Dorsie Lee JOHNSON, Jr., Petitioner,
v.
TEXAS.
No. 92–5653.
|
Argued April 26, 1993.
|
Decided June 24, 1993.
|
Rehearing Denied Aug. 9, 1993.
|
See 509 U.S. 941, 114 S.Ct. 15.

Justice SCALIA, concurring.

In my view the Lockett–Eddings principle that the sentencer must be allowed to consider “all relevant mitigating evidence” is quite incompatible with the Furman principle that the sentencer’s discretion must be channeled. See Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639, 656, 110 S.Ct. 3047, 3059, 111 L.Ed.2d 511 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). That will continue to be true unless and until the sort of “channeling” of mitigating discretion that Texas has engaged in here is not merely permitted (as the Court today holds), but positively *374 required—a further elaboration of our intricate Eighth Amendment jurisprudence that I neither look forward to nor would support.
 
Today’s decision, however, is simply a clarification (and I think a plainly correct one) of this Court’s opinions in Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U.S. 164, 108 S.Ct. 2320, 101 L.Ed.2d 155 (1988) (plurality opinion), and Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990), which I joined. In fact, the essence of today’s holding (to the effect that discretion may constitutionally be channeled) was set forth in my dissent in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 350, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 2963, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Accordingly, I join the opinion of the Court.
