RODNEY C. HANLON, JOEL SCRAFFORD, KRIS A. McLEAN, RICHARD C. BRANZELL, AND ROBERT PRIEKSAT, PETITIONERS v. PAUL W. BERGER ET UX.

No. 97-1927

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

526 U.S. 808

May 24, 1999, Decided

JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
As I explain in my dissent in Wilson v. Layne, ante at    , I am convinced that the constitutional rule recognized in that case had been clearly established long before 1992. I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court's disposition of this case on qualified immunity grounds.
