Appellants contend that 12 of Virginia’s state legislative districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. The three-judge District Court rejected their challenge, holding that race was not the legislature’s predominant motive in drawing 11 of the districts and that the remaining district survives strict scrutiny. I would reverse the District Court as to all 12 districts. I therefore concur in the judgment in part and dissent in part.
I
I concur in the Court’s judgment reversing the District Court’s decision to uphold 11 of the 12 districts at issue in this case—House Districts 63, 69, 70, 71, 74, 77, 80, 89, 90, 92, and 95. I do not agree, however, with the Court’s decision to leave open the question whether race predominated in those    districts and, thus, whether they are subject to strict scrutiny. Ante, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 98. Appellees (hereinafter State) concede that the legislature intentionally drew all 12 districts as majority-black districts. See, e.g., Brief for Appellees 1 (“[T]he legislature sought to achieve a [black voting-age population] of at least 55% in adjusting the lines of the 12 majority-minority districts”). That concession, in my view, mandates strict scrutiny as to each district. See Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 1000, 116 S. Ct. 1941, 135 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1996) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (A State’s “concession that it intentionally created majority-minority districts [i]s sufficient to show that race was a predominant, motivating factor in its redistricting”); League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U. S. 399, 517, 126 S. Ct. 2594, 165 L. Ed. 2d 609 (2006) (LULAC) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (“[W]hen a legislature intentionally creates a majority-minority district, race is necessarily its predominant motivation and strict scrutiny is therefore triggered”). I would therefore hold that the District Court must apply strict scrutiny to Districts 63, 69, 70, 71, 74, 77, 80, 89, 90, 92, and 95 on remand.
II
I disagree with the Court’s judgment with respect to the remaining district, District     75. The majority affirms the District Court’s holding that    District 75 is subject to strict scrutiny. With this I agree, because, as with the other 11 districts, the State conceded that it intentionally drew District 75 as a majority-black district.
I disagree, however, with the majority’s determination that District 75 satisfies strict scrutiny. This Court has held that a State may draw distinctions     among its citizens based on race only when it “is pursuing a compelling state interest” and has chosen “narrowly tailored” means to accomplish that interest. Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 908, 116 S. Ct. 1894, 135 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). The State asserts that it used race in drawing District 75 to further a “compelling interest in complying with Section 5 of the [Voting Rights Act of 1965].” Brief for Appellees 50. 1 And it argues that, based on its “good-faith functional analysis” of the district, it narrowly tailored its use of race to achieve that interest. Id., at 56. In my view, the State has neither asserted a compelling state interest nor narrowly tailored its use of race.
A
As an initial matter, the majority errs by “assum[ing], without deciding, that the State’s interest in complying with the Voting Rights Act was compelling.” Ante, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 98. To be sure, this Court has previously assumed that a State has a compelling    interest in complying with the Voting Rights Act. But it has done so only in cases in which it has not upheld the redistricting plan at issue. See, e.g., Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 921, 115 S. Ct. 2475, 132 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1995) (leaving open the question “[w]hether or not in some cases compliance with the [Voting Rights] Act, standing alone, can provide a compelling interest independent of any interest in remedying past discrimination”). 2 This Court has never, before today, assumed a compelling state interest while upholding a state redistricting plan. Indeed, I know of no other case, in any context, in which the Court has assumed away part of the State’s burden to justify its intentional use of race. This should not be the first. I would hold that complying with §5 of the Voting Rights Act is not a compelling interest.
“[C]ompliance with federal antidiscrimination laws cannot justify race-based districting where the challenged district was not reasonably necessary under a constitutional     reading and application of those laws.” Id., at 921 (emphasis added). More than a decade ago, I joined Justice Scalia’s opinion in LULAC, which noted that this Court had “upheld the constitutionality of §5 as a proper     exercise of Congress’s authority under §2 of the Fifteenth Amendment to enforce that Amendment’s    prohibition on the denial or abridgment of the right to vote.” 548 U. S., at 518, 126 S. Ct. 2594, 165 L. Ed. 2d 609. I therefore agreed that, “[i]n the proper case, . . . a covered jurisdiction may have a compelling interest in complying with §5.” Id., at 519, 126 S. Ct. 2594, 165 L. Ed. 2d 609.
I have since concluded that §5 is “unconstitutional.” Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U. S. 193, 216, 129 S. Ct. 2504, 174 L. Ed. 2d 140 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). “[T]he violence, intimidation, and subterfuge that led Congress to pass §5 and this Court to uphold it no longer remains,” id., at 229, 129 S. Ct. 2504, 174 L. Ed. 2d 140, so §5 “can no longer be justified as an appropriate mechanism for enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment,” id., at 216, 129 S. Ct. 2504, 174 L. Ed. 2d 140. Because, in my view, §5 is unconstitutional, I would hold that a State does not have a compelling interest in complying with it.
B
Even if compliance with §5 were a compelling interest, the State failed to narrowly tailor its use of race to further that interest.
1
This Court has explained that “[a]ny preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination.” Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 273, 106 S. Ct. 1842, 90 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1986) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 223, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 132 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1995); Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 378, 123 S. Ct. 2325, 156 L. Ed. 2d 304 (2003) (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). This exacting scrutiny makes sense because “[d]iscrimination on the basis of race” is “odious in all aspects.” Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U. S. 545, 555, 99 S. Ct. 2993, 61 L. Ed. 2d 739 (1979). Accordingly, a State’s use of race must bear “‘the most exact connection’” to the    compelling state interest. Wygant, supra, at 280, 106 S. Ct. 1842, 90 L. Ed. 2d 260 (opinion of Powell, J.). In the context of redistricting, the redistricting map must, “at a minimum,” actually “remedy the anticipated violation” or “achieve compliance” with the Voting Rights Act. Shaw, 517 U. S., at 916, 116 S. Ct. 1894, 135 L. Ed. 2d 207.
I have serious doubts about the Court’s standard for narrow tailoring, as characterized today and in Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U. S. ___, 135 S. Ct. 1257, 191 L. Ed. 2d 314, 336 (2015). Relying on Alabama, the majority explains that narrow tailoring in the redistricting context requires “only that the legislature have a strong basis in evidence in support of the (race-based) choice that it has made.” Ante, at ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 98 (internal quotation marks omitted). That standard “does not demand that a State’s actions actually be necessary to achieve a compelling state interest in order to be constitutionally valid.” Alabama, supra, at ___, 135 S. Ct. 1257, 191 L. Ed. 2d 314, 336 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also ante, at ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 98. Instead, under that standard, a state legislature needs only “good reasons to believe” that the     use of race is required, even if the use of race is not “actually . . . necessary.” Alabama, supra, at ___, 135 S. Ct. 1257, 191 L. Ed. 2d 314, 336 (internal quotation marks omitted).
That approach to narrow tailoring—deferring to a State’s belief that it has good reasons to use race—is “strict” in name only. To the extent the Court applies       Alabama to dilute the well-settled standard established by our precedents, I demur.
2
Applying the proper narrow-tailoring standard for state classifications based on race, I conclude that the State did not narrowly tailor its use of race to comply with §5. As the majority recognizes, §5 requires a state redistricting plan to maintain the black population’s ability to elect the candidate of its choice in the district at issue—in other words, the State must “avoid retrogression” in the new district. Ante, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 98.
The majority observes that the redistricting plan’s architect, Delegate Chris Jones, performed a “functional analysis” in deciding that District 75 required a 55% black voting-age population—as opposed to some other percentage—to avoid retrogression. Ibid. The Court notes that, in arriving at the 55% threshold, Delegate Jones considered turnout rates, the results of the primary and general elections in 2005, and the district’s “large population of disenfranchised black prisoners.” Ante, at ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 99. He also met with the incumbent delegate for District 75 “probably half a dozen times” and “discussed the district with incumbents from other majority-black districts.” Ante, at ___ - ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 99 (internal    quotation marks omitted). Those efforts add up, in the majority’s view, to a “careful assessment of local conditions and structures.” Ante, at ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 99.
I do not agree that those efforts satisfy narrow tailoring. Delegate Jones admitted that he was “not aware” of “any retrogress[ion] analysis” performed by “h[im] or any persons that worked with him in the development of the [redistricting] plan.” App. 288-289. Instead, he merely “look[ed] at” the “percentage of black population and the percentage of black voting age population,” “looked at what happened over the last 10 year period given the existing population and demographic shifts,” and “tried to restore back” the levels of black voting-age population from the previous maps. Id., at 290. That approach was misguided, because §5 “does not require maintaining the same population percentages in majority-minority districts as in the prior plan.” Alabama, supra, at ___, 135 S. Ct. 1257, 191 L. Ed. 2d 314, 334. And in any event, that back-of-the-envelope calculation does not qualify as rigorous analysis. I do not think we would permit so imprecise an approach with regard to any other instance of racial discrimination.
The other evidence cited by the majority is similarly weak. The majority points to the “‘half a dozen’” meetings between Delegate    Jones and the incumbent delegate for District 75, ante, at ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 99, but it is not apparent from the record whether District 75’s incumbent is the current black population’s candidate of choice. Moreover, the incumbent delegate may well have wanted her district to be electorally safer     than the Voting Rights Act requires. It also is not obvious to me that Delegate Jones was seeking to avoid retrogression in District 75 when he met with incumbent delegates from other majority-black districts. Ibid. In my view, those efforts fall far short of establishing that a 55% black voting-age population bears a more “‘exact connection’” to the State’s interest than any alternative percentage. Wygant, supra, at 279, 106 S. Ct. 1842, 90 L. Ed. 2d 260 (opinion of Powell, J.). Accordingly, I would hold that the State failed to narrowly tailor its use of race to avoid retrogression in District 75.
***
In reaching these conclusions, I recognize that this Court is at least as responsible as the state legislature for these racially gerrymandered districts. As explained above, this Court has repeatedly failed to decide whether compliance with the Voting Rights Act    is a compelling governmental interest. See supra, at ___, 197 L. Ed. 2d, at 102, and n. 2. Indeed, this Court has refused even to decide whether    §5 is constitutional, despite having twice taken cases to decide that question. Compare Juris. Statement in Northwest Austin, O. T. 2008, No. 08-322, p. i (presenting the question “[w]hether . . . the §5 preclearance requirement can be applied as a valid exercise of Congress’s remedial powers under the Reconstruction Amendments”), and Shelby County v. Holder, 568 U. S. 1006, 133 S. Ct. 594, 184 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2012) (granting certiorari on the question “[w]hether Congress’ decision in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act under the pre-existing coverage formula of Section 4(b) . . . violated the Tenth Amendment and Article IV of the United States Constitution”), with Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 197, 129 S. Ct. 2504, 174 L. Ed. 2d 140 (holding that the district at issue was eligible to seek bailout under the Voting Rights Act and therefore “not reach[ing] the constitutionality of §5”), and Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U. S. ___, ___, 133 S. Ct. 2612, 186 L. Ed. 2d 651 (2013) (holding only that the coverage formula under §4(b) was unconstitutional and “issu[ing] no holding on §5 itself”). As a result, the Court has left the State without clear guidance about its redistricting obligations under §5.
This Court has put the State in a similar bind with respect to narrow tailoring. To comply with §5, a State necessarily must make a deliberate and precise effort to sort its citizens on the basis of their race. But that result is fundamentally at odds with our “color-blind” Constitution, which “neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.” Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 559, 16 S. Ct. 1138, 41 L. Ed. 256 (1896) (Harlan, J.,    dissenting). That contradiction illustrates the perversity of the Court’s jurisprudence in this area as well as the uncomfortable position in which the State might find itself.
Despite my sympathy for the State, I cannot ignore the Constitution’s clear prohibition on state-sponsored race discrimination. “The Constitution abhors classifications based on race, not only because those classifications can harm favored races or are based on illegitimate motives, but also because every time the government places citizens on racial registers . . ., it demeans us all.” Grutter, 539 U. S., at 353, 123 S. Ct. 2325, 156 L. Ed. 2d 304 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). This     prohibition was “[p]urchased at the price of immeasurable human suffering,” and it “reflects our Nation’s understanding that such classifications ultimately have a destructive impact on the individual and our society.” Adarand Constructors, 515 U. S., at 240, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 132 L. Ed. 2d 158 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). I respectfully dissent from the Court’s judgment as to District 75.

 
1 It is unclear from the record whether the State sought to justify its use of race on other grounds. I would leave it to the District Court to evaluate in the first instance any other asserted compelling interest, including whether such interest has been forfeited.
