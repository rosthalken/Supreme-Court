MONTANA ET AL. v. UNITED STATES
Supreme Court of the United States
December 4, 1978, Argued ; February 22, 1979, Decided
No. 77-1134

MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion on the customary understanding that its references to law review articles and drafts or finally adopted versions of the Restatement of Judgements are not intended to bind the Court to the views expressed therein on issues not presented by the facts of this case.
