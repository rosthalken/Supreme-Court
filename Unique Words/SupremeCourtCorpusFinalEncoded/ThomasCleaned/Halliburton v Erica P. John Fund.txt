The implied Rule 10b-5 private cause of action is “a relic of the heady days in which this Court assumed common-law powers to create causes of action,” Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 75, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456 (2001) (Scalia, J., concurring); see, e.g., J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 433, 84 S. Ct. 1555, 12 L. Ed. 2d 423 (1964). We have since ended that practice because the authority to fashion private remedies to enforce federal law belongs to Congress alone. Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U.S. 148, 164, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627 (2008). Absent statutory authorization for a cause of action, “courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter.” Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286-287, 121 S. Ct. 1511, 149 L. Ed. 2d 517 (2001).
Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1988), demonstrates     the wisdom of this rule. Basic presented the question how investors must prove the reliance element of the implied Rule 10b-5 cause of action—the requirement that the plaintiff buy or sell stock    in reliance on the defendant’s misstatement—when they transact on modern, impersonal securities exchanges. Were the Rule 10b-5 action statutory, the Court could have resolved this question by interpreting the statutory language. Without a statute to interpret for guidance, however, the Court began instead with a particular policy “problem”: for investors in impersonal markets, the traditional reliance requirement was hard to prove and impossible to prove as common among plaintiffs bringing 10b-5 class-action suits. Id., at 242, 245, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194. With the task thus framed as “resol[ving]” that “‘problem’” rather than interpreting statutory text, id., at 242, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194, the Court turned to nascent economic theory and naked intuitions about investment behavior in its efforts to fashion a new, easier way to meet the reliance requirement. The result was an evidentiary presumption, based on a “fraud on the market” theory, that paved the way for class actions under Rule 10b-5.
Today we are asked to determine whether Basic was correctly decided.     The Court suggests that it was, and that stare decisis demands that we preserve it. I disagree. Logic, economic realities, and our subsequent jurisprudence have undermined    the foundations of the Basic presumption, and stare decisis cannot prop up the facade that remains. Basicshould be overruled.

Understanding where Basic went wrong requires an explanation of the “reliance” requirement as traditionally understood.
“Reliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant’s deceptive acts is an essential element” of the implied 10b-5 private cause of action. 1 Stoneridge, supra, at 159, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627. To prove reliance, the plaintiff must show “‘transaction causation,’” i.e., that the specific misstatement induced “the investor’s decision to engage in the transaction.” Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U.S. ___, ___-___, 131 S. Ct. 2179, 180 L. Ed. 2d 24, 29 (2011). Such proof “ensures that there is a proper ‘connection between a defendant’s misrepresentation and a plaintiff’s injury’”—namely, that the plaintiff has not just lost money as a result of the misstatement, but that he was actually defrauded by it. Id., at ___, 131 S. Ct. 2179, 180 L. Ed. 2d 24, 31; see also Dirks v. SEC, 463 U.S. 646, 666-667, n. 27, 103 S. Ct. 3255, 77 L. Ed. 2d 911 (1983) (“[T]o constitute a violation of Rule 10b-5, there must be fraud. . . . [T]here always are winners and losers; but those who have ‘lost’ have not necessarily been defrauded”). Without that    connection, Rule 10b-5 is reduced to a “‘scheme of investor’s insurance,’” because a plaintiff could recover whenever the defendant’s misstatement distorted the stock price—regardless of whether the misstatement had actually tricked the plaintiff into buying (or selling) the stock in the first place. Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 345, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577 (2005) (quoting    Basic, supra, at 252, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194 (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).
The “traditional” reliance element requires a plaintiff to “sho[w] that he was aware of a company’s statement and engaged in a relevant transaction . . . based on that specific misrepresentation.” Erica P. John Fund, supra, at ___, 131 S. Ct. 2179, 180 L. Ed. 2d 24, 28.    But investors who purchase stock from third parties on impersonal exchanges (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange) often will not be aware of any particular statement made by the issuer of the security, and therefore cannot establish that they transacted based on a specific misrepresentation. Nor is the traditional reliance requirement amenable to class treatment; the inherently individualized nature of the reliance inquiry renders it impossible for a 10b-5 plaintiff to prove that common questions predominate over individual ones, making class certification improper. See Basic, supra, at 242, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3).
    Citing these difficulties of proof and class certification, 485 U.S., at 242, 245, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194, the Basic Court dispensed with the traditional reliance requirement in favor of a new one based on the fraud-on-the-market theory. 2 The new version of reliance had two related parts.
First, Basic suggested that plaintiffs could meet the reliance requirement “‘indirectly,’” id., at 245, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194. The Court reasoned that “‘ideally, [the market] transmits information to the investor in the processed form of a market price.’” Id., at 244, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194. An investor could thus be said to have “relied” on a specific misstatement if (1) the market had incorporated that statement into the market price of the security, and (2) the investor then bought or sold that security “in reliance on the integrity of the [market] price,” id., at 247, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194, i.e., based on his belief that the market price “‘reflect[ed]’” the stock’s underlying “‘value,’” id., at 244, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194.
Second, Basic created a presumption that this “indirect” form of “reliance” had been proved. Based primarily on certain assumptions about economic theory and investor behavior, Basic afforded plaintiffs who traded    in efficient markets an evidentiary presumption that both steps of the novel reliance requirement had been satisfied—that (1) the market had incorporated the specific misstatement into the market price of the security, and (2) the plaintiff did transact in reliance on the integrity of that price. 3 Id., at 247, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194. A defendant was ostensibly entitled to rebut the presumption by putting forth evidence that either of those steps was absent. Id., at 248, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194.
II
Basic’s reimagined reliance requirement was a mistake, and the passage of     time has compounded its failings. First, the Court based both parts of the presumption of reliance on a questionable understanding of disputed economic theory and flawed intuitions about investor behavior. Second, Basic’s rebuttable presumption is at odds with our subsequent Rule 23 cases, which require plaintiffs seeking class certification to “‘affirmatively demonstrate’”    certification requirements like the predominance of common questions. Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. ___, ___, 133 S. Ct. 1426, 185 L. Ed. 2d 515, 521 (2013) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. ___, ___, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374, 390 (2011)). Finally, Basic’s presumption that investors rely on the integrity of the market price is virtually irrebuttable in practice, which means that the “essential”     reliance element effectively exists in name only.
A
Basic based the presumption of reliance on two factual assumptions. The first assumption was that, in a “well-developed market,” public statements are generally “reflected” in the market price of securities. 485 U.S., at 247, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194. The second was that investors in such markets transact “in reliance on the integrity of that price.” Ibid. In other words, the Court created a presumption that a plaintiff had met the two-part, fraud-on-the-market version of the reliance requirement because, in the Court’s view, “common sense and probability” suggested that each of those parts would be met. Id., at 246, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194.
In reality, both of the Court’s key assumptions are highly contestable and do not provide the necessary support for Basic’s    presumption of reliance. The first assumption—that public statements are “reflected” in the market price—was grounded in an economic theory that has garnered substantial criticism since Basic. The second assumption—that investors categorically rely on the integrity of the market price—is simply wrong.
1
The Court’s first assumption was that “most publicly available information”—including public misstatements—“is reflected in [the] market price” of a security. Id., at 247, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194. The Court grounded that assumption in “empirical studies” testing a then-nascent economic theory known as the efficient capital markets hypothesis. Id., at 246-247, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194. Specifically, the Court relied upon the “semi-strong” version of that theory, which posits that the average investor cannot earn above-market returns (i.e., “beat the market”) in an efficient market by trading on the basis of publicly available information. See, e.g., Stout, The Mechanisms of Market Inefficiency: An Introduction to the New Finance, 28 J. Corp. L. 635, 640, and n. 24 (2003) (citing Fama, Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work, 25 J. Finance 383, 388 (1970)). 4 The upshot of the hypothesis is that “the market price    of shares traded on well-developed markets [will] reflec[t] all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.” Basic, supra, at 246, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194. At the time of Basic, this version of the efficient capital markets hypothesis     was “widely accepted.” See Dunbar & Heller 463-464.
This view of market efficiency has since lost its luster. See, e.g., Langevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking Fraud on the Market, 2009 Wis. L. Rev. 151, 175 (“Doubts about the strength and pervasiveness of market efficiency are much greater today than they were in the mid-1980s”). As it turns out, even “well-developed” markets (like the New York Stock Exchange) do not uniformly incorporate     information into market prices with high    speed. “[F]riction in accessing public information” and the presence of “processing costs” means that “not all public information will be impounded in a security’s price with the same alacrity, or perhaps with any quickness at all.” Cox, Understanding Causation in Private Securities Lawsuits: Building on Amgen, 66 Vand. L. Rev. 1719, 1732 (2013) (hereinafter Cox). For example, information that is easily digestible (merger announcements or stock splits) or especially prominent (Wall Street Journal articles) may be incorporated quickly, while information that is broadly applicable or technical (Securities and Exchange Commission filings) may be incorporated slowly or even ignored. See Stout, supra, at 653-656; see e.g., In re Merck & Co. Securities Litigation, 432 F. 3d 261, 263-265 (CA3 2005) (a Wall Street Journal article caused a steep decline in the company’s stock price even though the same information was contained in an earlier SEC disclosure).
Further, and more importantly, “overwhelming empirical evidence” now suggests that even when markets do incorporate public information, they often fail to do so accurately. Lev and de Villiers, Stock Price Crashes and 10b-5 Damages: A Legal,    Economic and Policy Analysis, 47 Stan. L. Rev. 7, 20-21 (1994); see also id., at 21 (“That many share price movements seem unrelated to specific information strongly suggests that capital markets are not fundamentally efficient, and that wide deviations from fundamentals . . . can occur”(footnote omitted)). “Scores” of “efficiency-defying anomalies”—such as market swings in the absence of new information and prolonged deviations from underlying asset values—make market efficiency “more contestable than ever.” Langevoort, Taming the Animal Spirits of the Stock Markets: A Behavioral Approach to Securities Regulation, 97 Nw. U. L. Rev. 135, 141 (2002); Dunbar & Heller 476-483. Such anomalies make it difficult to tell whether, at any given moment, a stock’s price accurately reflects its value as indicated by all publicly available information. In sum, economists now understand that the price impact Basic assumed would happen reflexively is actually far from certain even in “well-developed” markets. Thus, Basic’s claim that “common sense and probability” support a presumption of reliance rests on shaky footing.
2
The Basic Court also grounded the presumption of reliance in a second assumption:    that “[a]n investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price.” 485 U.S., at 247, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194. In other words, the Court assumed that investors transact based on the belief that the market price accurately reflects the underlying “‘value’” of the security. See id., at 244, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194 (“‘[P]urchasers generally rely on the price of the stock as a reflection of its value’”). The Basic Court appears to have adopted this assumption about investment behavior based only on what it believed to be “common sense.” Id., at 246, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194. The Court found it “‘hard to imagine that there ever is a buyer or seller who does     not rely on market integrity. Who would knowingly roll the dice in a crooked crap game?’” Id., at 246-247, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194.
    The Court’s rather superficial analysis does not withstand scrutiny. It cannot be seriously disputed that a great many investors do not buy or sell stock based on a belief that the stock’s price accurately reflects its value. Many investors in fact trade for the opposite reason—that is, because they think the market has under- or overvalued the stock, and they believe they can profit from that mispricing. Id., at 256, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194 (opinion of White, J.); see,    e.g., Macey, The Fraud on the Market Theory: Some Preliminary Issues, 74 Cornell L. Rev. 923, 925 (1989) (The “opposite” of Basic’s assumption appears to be true; some investors “attempt to locate undervalued stocks in an effort to ‘beat the market’ . . . in essence betting that the market . . . is in fact inefficient”). Indeed, securities transactions often take place because the transacting parties disagree on the security’s value. See, e.g., Stout, Are Stock Markets Costly Casinos? Disagreement, Market Failure, and Securities Regulation, 81 Va. L. Rev. 611, 619 (1995) (“[A]vailable evidence suggests that . . . investor disagreement inspires the lion’s share of equities transactions”).
Other investors trade for reasons entirely unrelated to price—for instance, to address changing liquidity needs, tax concerns, or portfolio balancing requirements. See id., at 657-658; see also Cox 1739 (investors may purchase “due to portfolio rebalancing arising from its obeisance to an indexing strategy”). These investment decisions—made with indifference to price and thus without regard for price “integrity”—are at odds with Basic’s understanding of what motivates investment decisions. In short,    Basic’s assumption that all investors rely in common on “price integrity” is simply wrong. 5
The majority tries (but fails) to reconcile Basic’s assumption about investor behavior with the reality that many investors do not behave in the way Basic assumed. It first asserts that Basic rested only on the more modest view that    “‘most investors’” rely on the integrity of a security’s market price. Ante, at ___, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 354 (quoting not Basic, but Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans & Trust Funds, 568 U.S. ___, ___, 133 S. Ct. 1184, 185 L. Ed. 2d 308, 317 (2013) (emphasis added)). That gloss is difficult to square with Basic’s plain language: “An investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price.” Basic, 458 U.S., at 247, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194; see also id., at 246-247, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194 (“‘[I]t is hard to imagine that there ever is a buyer or seller who does not rely on market integrity’”). In any event, neither Basic nor the majority offers anything more than a judicial hunch as evidence that even “most” investors rely on price integrity.
    The majority also suggests that “there is no reason to suppose” that investors who     buy stock they believe to be undervalued are “indifferent to the integrity of market prices.” Ante, at ___, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 354. Such “value investor[s],” according to the majority, “implicitly rel[y] on the fact that a stock’s market price will eventually reflect material information” and “presumably tr[y] to estimate how undervalued or overvalued a particular stock is” by reference to the market price. Ibid. Whether    the majority’s unsupported claims about the thought processes of hypothetical investors are accurate or not, they are surely beside the point. Whatever else an investor believes about the market, he simply does not “rely on the integrity of the market price” if he does not believe that the market price accurately reflects public information at the time he transacts. That is, an investor cannot claim that a public misstatement induced his transaction by distorting the market price if he did not buy at that price while believing that it accurately incorporated that public information. For that sort of investor, Basic’s critical fiction falls apart.
B
Basic’s presumption of reliance also conflicts with our more recent cases clarifying Rule 23’s class-certification requirements. Those cases instruct that “a party seeking to maintain a class action ‘must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance’ with Rule 23.” Comcast, 569 U.S., at ___, 133 S. Ct. 1426, 185 L. Ed. 2d 515, 521 (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S., at ___, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374, 390. To prevail on a motion for class certification, a party must demonstrate through “evidentiary proof” that “‘questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions    affecting only individual members.’” 569 U.S., at ___, 133 S. Ct. 1426, 185 L. Ed. 2d 515, 519 (quoting Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3)).
Basic permits plaintiffs to bypass that requirement of evidentiary proof. Under Basic, plaintiffs who invoke the presumption of reliance (by proving its predicates) are deemed to have met the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). See ante, at ___, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 355; Amgen, supra, at ___, 133 S. Ct. 1184, 185 L. Ed. 2d 308, 314) (Basic “facilitates class certification by recognizing a rebuttable presumption of classwide reliance”);Basic, 485 U.S., at 242, 250, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194 (holding that the District Court appropriately certified the class based on the presumption of reliance). But, invoking the Basic presumption does not actually prove that individual questions of reliance will not overwhelm the common questions in the case. Basic still requires a showing that the individual investor bought or sold in reliance on the integrity of the market price and, crucially, permits defendants to rebut the presumption by producing evidence that individual plaintiffs do not meet that description. See id., at 249, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194 (“Petitioners . . . could rebut the presumption of reliance as to plaintiffs who would have divested themselves of their Basic    shares without relying on the integrity of the market”). Thus, by its own terms, Basic entitles defendants to ask each class member whether he traded in reliance on the integrity of the market price. That inquiry, like the traditional reliance inquiry, is inherently individualized; questions about the trading strategies of individual investors will not generate “‘common answers apt to drive the     resolution of the litigation,’” Wal-Mart Stores, supra, at ___, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374, 390. See supra, at ___ - ___, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 365-366; see also Cox 1736, n. 55 (Basic’s recognition that defendants could rebut the presumption “by proof the investor would have traded anyway appears to require individual inquiries into reliance”).
Basic thus exempts Rule 10b-5 plaintiffs from Rule 23’s proof requirement. Plaintiffs     who invoke the presumption of reliance are deemed to have shown predominance as a matter of law, even though the resulting rebuttable presumption leaves individualized questions of reliance in the case and predominance still unproved. Needless to say, that exemption was beyond the Basic Court’s power to grant. 6
C
It would be bad enough if Basic merely provided an end-run around Rule 23. But in practice, the so-called “rebuttable presumption” is largely irrebuttable.
The Basic Court ostensibly afforded defendants an opportunity to rebut the presumption by providing evidence that either aspect of a plaintiff’s fraud-on-the-market reliance—price impact, or reliance on the integrity of the market price—is missing. 485 U.S., at 248-249, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194. As it turns out, however, the realities of class-action procedure make rebuttal based on an individual plaintiff’s lack of reliance virtually impossible. At the class-certification stage, rebuttal is only directed at the class representatives, which means that counsel only needs to find one class member who can withstand the challenge. See Grundfest,    Damages and Reliance Under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 69 Bus. Lawyer 307, 362 (2014). After class certification, courts have refused to allow defendants to challenge any plaintiff’s reliance on the integrity of the market price prior to a determination on classwide liability. See Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America et al. as Amici Curiae 13-14 (collecting cases rejecting postcertification attempts to rebut individual class members’ reliance on price integrity as not pertinent to classwide liability). One search for rebuttals on individual-reliance grounds turned up only six cases out of the thousands of Rule 10b-5 actions brought since Basic. Grundfest, supra, at 360. 7
The apparent unavailability of this form of rebuttal has troubling implications.     Because the presumption is conclusive in practice with respect to investors’ reliance on price integrity, even Basic’s watered-down reliance requirement has been effectively eliminated. Once the presumption attaches, the reliance element is no longer an obstacle to prevailing on the claim, even though many class members will not have transacted in reliance on price integrity, see supra, at ___ - ___, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 365-366. And without a functional reliance requirement, the “essential element” that ensures the plaintiff     has actually been defrauded, see Stoneridge, 552 U.S., at 159, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627, Rule 10b-5 becomes the very “‘scheme of investor’s insurance’” the rebuttable presumption was supposed to prevent. See Basic, supra, at 252, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194 (opinion of White, J.). 8
* * *
For these reasons, Basic should be overruled in favor of the straightforward rule that “[r]eliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant’s deceptive acts”—actual reliance, not the fictional “fraud-on-the-market” version—“is an essential element of the §10(b) private cause of action.” Stoneridge, 552 U.S., at 159, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627.
III
Principles of stare decisis do not compel us to save Basic’s muddled logic and armchair economics. We have not hesitated to overrule decisions when they are “unworkable or are badly reasoned,” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 827, 111 S. Ct. 2597, 115 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1991); when “the theoretical underpinnings of those decisions are called into serious question,” State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 21, 118 S. Ct. 275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997); when the decisions have become “irreconcilable” with intervening developments in “competing legal doctrines or policies,”Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 173, 109 S. Ct. 2363, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1989); or when they are otherwise “a positive detriment to coherence and consistency in the law,”    ibid. Just one of these circumstances can justify our correction of bad precedent; Basic checks all the boxes.
In support of its decision to preserve Basic, the majority contends that stare decisis “has ‘special force’ ‘in respect to statutory interpretation’ because ‘Congress remains free to alter what we have done.’” Ante, at ___, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 354 (quoting John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U.S. 130, 139, 128 S. Ct. 750, 169 L. Ed. 2d 591 (2008); some internal quotation marks omitted). But Basic, of course, has nothing to do with statutory interpretation. The case concerned a judge-made evidentiary presumption for a judge-made element of the implied 10b-5 private cause of action, itself “a judicial construct that Congress did not enact in the text of the relevant statutes.” Stoneridge, supra, at 164, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627. We have not afforded stare decisis “special force” outside the context of statutory interpretation,     see Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S. ___, ___, n. 6, 134 S. Ct. 2024, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1071, 1089 (2014) (Thomas, J. dissenting) and for good reason. In statutory cases, it is perhaps plausible that Congress watches over its enactments and will step in to fix our mistakes, so we may leave to Congress the judgment whether the interpretive    question is better left “‘settled’” or “‘settled right,’” Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U.S. 409, 424, 106 S. Ct. 1922, 90 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1986). But this rationale is untenable when it comes to judge-made law like “implied” private causes of action, which we retain a duty to superintend. See, e.g.,    Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554 U.S. 471, 507, 128 S. Ct. 2605, 171 L. Ed. 2d 570 (2008) (“[T]he judiciary [cannot] wash its hands of a problem it created . . . simply by calling [the judicial doctrine] legislative”). Thus, when we err in areas of judge-made law, we ought to presume that Congress expects us to correct our own mistakes—not the other way around. That duty is especially clear in the Rule 10b-5 context, where we have said that “[t]he federal courts have accepted and exercised the principal responsibility for the continuing elaboration of the scope of the 10b-5 right and the definition of the duties it imposes.” Musick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 508 U.S. 286, 292, 113 S. Ct. 2085, 124 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1993).
Basic’s presumption of reliance remains our mistake to correct. Since Basic, Congress has enacted two major securities laws: the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 109 Stat. 737, and the Securities Litigation    Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA), 112 Stat. 3227. The PSLRA “sought to combat perceived abuses in securities litigation,” ante, at ___, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 356, and SLUSA prevented plaintiffs from avoiding the PSLRA’s restrictions by bringing class actions in state court, ibid. Neither of these Acts touched the reliance element of the implied Rule 10b-5 private cause of action or the Basic presumption.
Contrary to respondent’s argument (the majority wisely skips this next line of defense), we cannot draw from Congress’ silence on this matter an inference that Congress approved of Basic. To begin with, it is inappropriate to give weight to “Congress’ unenacted opinion” when construing judge-made doctrines, because doing so allows the Court to create law and then “effectively codif[y]” it “based only on Congress’ failure to address it.” Bay Mills, supra, at ___, 134 S. Ct. 2024, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1071, 1107 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Our Constitution, however, demands that laws be passed by Congress and signed by the President. U.S. Const., Art. I, §7. Adherence to Basic based on congressional inaction would invert that requirement by insulating error from correction merely because Congress failed to pass a law on the subject. Cf. Patterson, supra, at 175, n. 1, 109 S. Ct. 2363, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132    (“Congressional inaction cannot amend a duly enacted statute”).
At any rate, arguments from legislative inaction are speculative at best. “[I]t is ‘ “impossible to assert with any degree of assurance that congressional failure to act represents” affirmative congressional approval of’ one of this Court’s decisions.” Bay Mills, supra, at ___, 134 S. Ct. 2024, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1071, 1107 (Thomas, J., dissenting) quoting Patterson, supra, at 175, n. 1, 109 S. Ct. 2363, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132). “‘Congressional inaction lacks persuasive     significance’” because it is indeterminate; “‘several equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction.’” Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.S. 164, 187, 114 S. Ct. 1439, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1994) (quoting Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 650, 110 S. Ct. 2668, 110 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1990)). Therefore, “[i]t does not follow . . . that Congress’ failure to overturn a . . . precedent is reason for this Court to adhere to it.” Patterson, supra, at 175, n. 1, 109 S. Ct. 2363, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132.
That is especially true here, because Congress passed a law to tell us not to draw any inference from its inaction. The PSLRA expressly states that “[n]othing in this Act . . . shall be deemed to create or ratify any implied private right of action.” Notes following    15 U.S.C. §78j-1, p. 430. If the Act did not ratify even the Rule 10b-5     private cause of action, it cannot be read to ratify sub silentio the presumption of reliance this Court affixed to that action. Further, the PSLRA and SLUSA operate to curtail abuses of various private causes of action under our securities laws—hardly an indication that Congress approved of Basic’s expansion of the 10b-5 private cause of action. Congress’ failure to overturn Basic does not permit us to “place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court’s own error.” Girouard v. United States, 328 U.S. 61, 70, 66 S. Ct. 826, 90 L. Ed. 1084 (1946).

Basic took an implied cause of action and grafted on a policy-driven presumption of reliance based on nascent economic theory and personal intuitions about investment behavior. The result was an unrecognizably broad cause of action ready made for class certification. Time and experience have pointed up the error of that decision, making it all too clear that the Court’s attempt to revise securities law to fit the alleged “new realities of financial markets” should have been left to Congress. 485 U.S., at 255, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194 (opinion of White, J.).
 
1 As the private Rule 10b-5 action has evolved, the Court has drawn on the common-law action of deceit to identify six elements a private plaintiff must prove: “‘(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.’” Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, 568 U.S. ___, ___-___, 133 S. Ct. 1184, 185 L. Ed. 2d 308, 316 (2013).

 
 
2 In the years preceding Basic, lower courts and commentators experimented with various ways to facilitate 10b-5 class actions by relaxing or eliminating the reliance element of the implied 10b-5 action. See, e.g., Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F. 2d 891 (CA9 1975); Note, The Fraud-on-the-Market Theory, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1143 (1982);    Note, The Reliance Requirement in Private Actions under SEC Rule 10b-5, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 584, 592-606 (1975). The “fraud-on-the-market theory” is an umbrella term for those varied efforts. Black, Fraud on the Market: A Criticism of Dispensing with Reliance Requirements in Certain Open Market Transactions, 62 N. C. L. Rev. 435, 439-457 (1984).

 
 
3 An investor could invoke this presumption by demonstrating certain predicates: (1) a public statement; (2) an efficient market; (3) that the shares were traded after the statement was made but before the truth was revealed; and (4) that the statement was material. Basic, 485 U.S., at 248, n. 27, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194.

 
 
4 The “weak form” of the hypothesis provides that an investor cannot earn an above-market return by trading on historical price data. See Dunbar & Heller, Fraud on the Market Meets Behavioral Finance, 31 Del. J. Corporate L. 455, 463-464 (2006) (hereinafter Dunbar & Heller). The “strong form” provides that investors cannot achieve above-market returns even by trading on nonpublic information. See ibid. The weak form is generally accepted; the strong form is not. See ibid.

 
 
5 The Basic Court’s mistaken intuition about investor behavior appears to involve a category mistake: the Court invoked a hypothesis meant to describe markets, but then used it “in the one way it is not meant to be used: as a predictor of the behavior of individual investors.” Langevoort, Theories, Assumptions, and Securities Regulation: Market Efficiency Revisited, 140 U. Pa. L. Rev. 851, 895 (1992). The efficient capital markets hypothesis does not describe “how investors behave; [it] only suggests the consequences of their collective behavior.” Cox 1736. “Nothing in the hypothesis denies what most popular accounts assume: that much information searching and trading by investors, from institutions on down, is done in the (perhaps erroneous) belief that undervalued or overvalued stocks exist and can systematically be discovered.” Langevoort, Theories, supra, at 895.

 
 
6 The majority suggests that Basic squares with Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. ___, 133 S. Ct. 1426, 185 L. Ed. 2d 515 (2013), and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. ___, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011),    because it does not “relieve plaintiffs of the burden of proving . . . predominance” but “rather sets forth what they must prove to demonstrate such predominance.” Ante, at ___ - ___, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 355-356. This argument misses the point. Because Basic offers defendants a chance to rebut the presumption on individualized grounds, the predicates that Basic sets forth as sufficient to invoke the presumption do not necessarily prove predominance.

 
 
7 The absence of postcertification rebuttal is likely attributable in part to the substantial in terrorem settlement pressures brought to bear by certification. See, e.g., Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 97, 99 (2009) (“With vanishingly rare exception, class certification sets the litigation on a path toward resolution by way of settlement, not full-fledged testing of the plaintiffs’ case by trial”); see also Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U.S. 148, 163, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627 (2008)    (“[E]xtensive discovery and the potential for uncertainty and disruption in a lawsuit allow plaintiffs with weak claims to extort settlements from innocent companies”).

 
 
8 Of course, today’s decision makes clear that a defendant may rebut the presumption by producing evidence that the misstatement at issue failed to affect the market price of the security, see ante, at ___ - ___, 189 L. Ed. 2d, at 357-360. But both parts of Basic’s    version of reliance are key to its fiction that an investor has “indirectly” relied on the misstatement; the unavailability of rebuttal with respect to one of those parts still functionally removes reliance as an element of proof.
