JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE BLACKMUN join, dissenting.

Even though the Court may regard the practice as "novel, costly, and intuitively [****26]  unsatisfying," ante, at 687, n. 8, it is not at all unusual for a government to pay an unsuccessful adversary's counsel fees; indeed, in the largest category of litigation in which governments engage -- criminal litigation -- they do so routinely. 1Link to the text of the note The question presented in this case is whether Congress has authorized any such award in a challenge to rulemaking by the Environmental Protection Agency. Today the Court holds that, no matter how exceptional the circumstances may be, Congress intended such awards to be made only to prevailing parties. But in § 307(f) Congress deliberately used language that differs from the "prevailing party" standard, and it carefully explained in the legislative history that it intended to give the courts of appeals discretionary authority to award fees and costs to a broader category of parties. If one reads that statute and its legislative history without any strong predisposition in favor of or against the "American Rule" endorsed by the Court in Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975), and repeatedly rejected by Congress thereafter, the answer is really quite plain -- and it is not [****27]  the one the Court engrafts on the statute.

 [*695]  I

The Court gives a one-dimensional description of the role played by respondents, Sierra Club and the Environmental Defense Fund, in the Sierra Club v. Costle, 211 U. S. App. D. C. 336, 657 F.2d 298 (1981), litigation: they failed to obtain any of the relief they requested. It is necessary to examine this uniquely important and complex litigation more thoroughly in order to illuminate the other considerations that are relevant to an award of attorney's fees under § 307(f) of the Clean Air Act.

 [***950]  The millions of tons of sulfur dioxide emitted by coal-burning powerplants constitute  [**3283]  a major source of air pollution in the United States. One method of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions is to install flue gas desulfurization equipment; another is to burn coal with lower sulfur content. In 1977 Congress amended the section of the Clean [****28]  Air Act governing emission standards for newly built or modified stationary pollution sources, including powerplants. These amendments raised significant questions regarding the pollution control methods that would be required in new powerplants and the levels of sulfur dioxide emissions that would result across the Nation. Section 111, as amended, required EPA to establish standards setting an emission ceiling for each category of new sources and also requiring each such plant to achieve a "percentage reduction" in the emissions that would have resulted from the use of untreated fuels. 2Link to the text of the note In 1979, following a lengthy rulemaking proceeding under the Act, the EPA promulgated a controversial new standard for sulfur dioxide emissions by coal-burning powerplants. The standard  [*696]  established an emissions ceiling of 1.2 pounds/MBtu of sulfur dioxide for all new plants. In addition, it required each new plant to achieve 90% reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions, given the sulfur content of the coal used, except that plants using coal with sufficiently low sulfur content could reduce their emissions by as little as 70% as long as the resulting emissions did not exceed 0.6 pounds/MBtu.  [****29]  3Link to the text of the note

The provisions of EPA's sulfur dioxide standard were interrelated. The Clean Air Act requires EPA to engage in a balancing of factors: "a standard of performance shall reflect the degree of emission limitation and the percentage reduction [****30]  achievable through application of the best technological system of continuous emission reduction which (taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, any nonair quality health and environmental impact and energy requirements) the Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated." 42 U. S. C. § 7411(a)(1)(C) (1976 ed., Supp. V). Thus, in the rulemaking proceeding, EPA considered various projections of the aggregate costs and nationwide levels of sulfur dioxide emissions that would result from different combinations of requirements. Its evaluation of various proposed standards relied on its understanding of the state of available technology, the likelihood of future technological improvements, and the availability of various types of coal with differing sulfur content. 4Link to the text of the note

 [****31]   [***951]  A number of parties filed petitions for review of the EPA's action in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. As the Court of Appeals wrote: "On  [*697]  this appeal we consider challenges to the revised NSPS [new source performance standards] brought by environmental groups which contend that the standards are too lax and by electric utilities which contend that the standards are too rigorous." Sierra Club v. Costle, 211 U. S. App. D. C., at 349-350, 657 F.2d, at 311-312. Eighty-seven utility companies and two utility industry organizations challenged the strictness of the 90% reduction requirement as well as the 0.03 pounds/ MBtu limit on emissions of particulate matter. On the other hand, the Sierra Club and the State of California Air Resources Board opposed the variable percentage  [**3284]  reduction standard, contending that the statute required a uniform percentage reduction and that the record did not support EPA's action. The Environmental Defense Fund challenged the 1.2 pounds/MBtu ceiling on procedural grounds, contending that EPA failed to adopt a more stringent standard because of ex parte [****32]  contacts after the close of the comment period. Intervenor-respondents in the Court of Appeals included various electric utilities, which filed briefs defending the variable percentage reduction standard and the 1.2 pounds/MBtu ceiling, and the National Coal Association, which opposed EDF's claim that the 1.2 pounds/MBtu standard was invalid due to procedural impropriety.

These complex, interrelated contentions presented the Court of Appeals with an immense judicial task.



"In formulating the regulation, EPA had prepared 120 studies, collected 400 items of reference literature, received almost 1,400 comments, written 650 letters and 200 interagency memoranda, held over 50 meetings and substantive telephone conversations with the public, and conducted four days of public hearings. The statement accompanying the regulation took up to 43 pages with triple columns and single-spaced type. Approximately 700 pages of briefs were submitted to this court on the merits of the case. The joint appendix contained 5,620  [*698]  pages, bound in 12 volumes. The certified index to the record listed over 2,520 submissions." Sierra Club v. Gorsuch, 217 U. S. App. D. C. 180, 187, 672 F.2d 33, 40 (1982). [****33]  5Link to the text of the note

The Court of Appeals rejected the petitions for review filed by the respondents in this case, the Sierra Club and the Environmental Defense Fund, although not entirely for the reasons stated by EPA; it also rejected the contentions of the utilities. The opinion, 256 pages in printed slip opinion form and 132 pages in the Federal Reporter, ended with "a short conclusion: the rule is reasonable." 211 U. S. App. D. C., at 448, 657 F.2d, at 410. 6Link to the text of the note

 [****34]   [***952]  After further proceedings, the Court of Appeals unanimously decided that it was appropriate to award attorney's fees to both respondents. 7Link to the text of the note It first concluded that § 307(f) gave it authority to award fees in an "appropriate" case even to a party that did not prevail on any issue it addressed. The court then explained in some detail the grounds for its conclusion that the respondents had substantially contributed  [*699]  to the goals of the Act. "While the occasions upon which non-prevailing parties will meet such criteria may be exceptional, . . . Sierra Club is such an occasion." 217 U. S. App. D. C., at 186, 672 F.2d, at 39. 8Link to the text of the note

 [****35]  Sierra Club, the court noted, was the only party to brief and advocate opposition to a variable standard, an issue conceded  [**3285]  by EPA to be critically important. Had this issue not been debated, moreover, the outcome of other related issues in the case -- including the appropriateness of the 1.2 pounds/MBtu standard and the technological feasibility of the 90% reduction requirement -- might have been affected. The court expressly stated: "[The] argument pressed most intensely by the utilities, that a 90% reduction in sulfur emissions was technologically infeasible given the state of antipollution technology, would have been far less completely aired without Sierra Club's participation. The various parts of a complex rule like this one do not travel alone, and the court's education on each part of the rule informed its decisions on other parts." Id., at 188, 672 F.2d, at 41. 9Link to the text of the note

 [****36]  The Court of Appeals explained that, even though respondents were not "prevailing parties," either in whole or in part,  [*700]  their participation may have made a difference in the outcome of the litigation.

"It was absolutely essential in a case of this dimension that this court have expert and articulate spokesmen for environmental as well as industrial interests. The rulemaking process not only involved highly technical and complex data, but controversial considerations of public policy. Given the complexity of the subject matter, without competent representatives  [***953]  of environmental interests, the process of judicial review might have been fatally skewed." Ibid.

The then EPA Administrator disputed the amount of the fee award in the Court of Appeals, but petitioner does not contest its reasonableness before this Court. Petitioner also apparently does not assert that, if it is ever appropriate to award fees to a losing party, the Court of Appeals improperly exercised its discretion to make an award in this case. 10Link to the text of the note Rather, petitioner asserts as a matter of law that § 307(f) of the Clean Air Act should be construed to forbid any award to any [****37]  nonprevailing party. The majority accepts this contention. But the language of § 307(f), the legislative history, and the legislative history of § 304(d) all demonstrate that petitioner's position should be rejected.

II

The language of § 307(f) is straightforward. It provides:

"In any judicial proceeding under this section, the court may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney  [*701]  and expert witness fees) whenever it determines that such award is [****38]  appropriate." 42 U. S. C. § 7607(f) (1976 ed., Supp. V).

The challenge to the sulfur dioxide emission standard in the Court of Appeals was unquestionably a "judicial proceeding under" § 307. That court explained the reasons why it believed that an award was appropriate in this case. It therefore complied with the plain language of the statute.

As the Court of Appeals correctly observed, the language of § 307(f) differs  [**3286]  crucially from the wording of many other federal statutes authorizing the court to award attorney's fees and costs. 11Link to the text of the note [****39]  Most of those statutes expressly require that a party "prevail" or "substantially prevail"  [***954]  in order to obtain fees. 12Link to the text of the note The contrast between the text of § 307(f) and  [*702]  the text of other attorney's fees statutes strongly supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend the outcome of the case to be conclusive in the decision whether to award fees under § 307(f).

 [****40]  Nevertheless the Court today asserts that a statute which does not refer to "prevailing parties" actually does refer to "prevailing parties." It does so by invoking the "American Rule" that losing parties do not pay the attorney's fees of their successful opponents, and by asserting that "virtually every one of the more than 150 existing federal fee-shifting provisions predicates fee awards on some success by the claimant." Ante, at 684. Factually, as the Court's own opinion makes clear, this is something of an overstatement. After all, the Court notes that 16 federal statutes and § 304(d) of the Clean Air Act contain provisions for awards of attorney's fees identical to § 307(f). Ante, at 682-683, n. 1. Logically  [*703]  the assertion is a non sequitur. It begs the question at issue in this case -- whether, by using significantly different language in § 307(f), Congress wished to depart from or to adopt the more customary standard. 13Link to the text of the note

 [****41]   [**3287]  III

The legislative history, like the  [***955]  text of the statute, supports the conclusion that Congress intended to allow attorney's fees not only to prevailing parties but also, in appropriate circumstances, to nonprevailing parties. In 1977, when § 307(f) was added to the Clean Air Act, the Senate Committee considered, but did not adopt, a provision that would have required the Court of Appeals to award fees to any "party other than the United States which prevails in such action" and would have given it discretion to award fees to a party "[in] any case in which such party prevails in part." 14Link to the text of the note [****43]   [*704]  The Senate Report explained that, under the different provision the Committee had chosen to adopt, fees and costs may be awarded "whenever the court determines that such an award is appropriate." 15Link to the text of the note It is clear from the House Report that the language of § 307(f), "whenever [the court] determines that such an award is appropriate," was intended to be broader than a "prevailing party" standard:

"In the case of the section 307 judicial review litigation, the purposes of the authority to award fees are not only to discourage frivolous litigation, but [****42]  also to encourage litigation which will assure proper implementation and administration of the act of otherwise serve the public interest. The committee did not intend that the court's discretion to award fees under this provision should be restricted to cases in which the party seeking fees was the 'prevailing party'. In fact, such an amendment was expressly rejected by the committee, largely on the grounds set forth in NRDC v. EPA, 484 F.2d 1331, 1388 (1st Cir. 1973)." H. R. Rep. No. 95-294, p.  [***956]  337 (1977), 4 1977 Leg. Hist., at 2804 (emphasis supplied). 16Link to the text of the note

 [****44]   [*705]   [**3288]  The cited portion of the opinion of the First Circuit in Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 484 F.2d 1331, 1338 (1973), 17Link to the text of the note sets forth the test of whether the party seeking fees has contributed to the goals of the environmental statute -- a different test from whether it has prevailed. Judge Campbell wrote:

"The authorizing language of § 304(d) permits an award 'to any party, whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.' This suggests greater latitude even than is found in 28 U. S. C. § 2412, which authorizes awards to 'the prevailing party'. We are at liberty to consider not merely 'who won' but what benefits were  [*706]  conferred. The purpose of an award of costs and fees is not mainly punitive. It is to allocate the costs of litigation equitably, to encourage the achievement of statutory goals. When the government is attempting to carry out a program of such vast and unchartered dimensions, there are roles for both the official agency and a private watchdog. The legislation is itself novel and complex. Given the implementation dates, its early interpretation is desirable.  [****45]  It is our impression, overall, that petitioners, in their watchdog role, have performed a service." Ibid.

In the NRDC case the party receiving the fee award had prevailed on some issues. The court noted that even those challenges that were "not sustained, were mainly constructive and reasonable." Ibid. 18Link to the text of the note Today the  [***957]  majority seizes on this fact in an attempt to explain away the clear intention stated in the Senate Report. But the Committee adopted the reasoning, not the facts, of the opinion in NRDC v. EPA.

 [****46]  IV

Unpersuaded by the statutory language and legislative history, the Court relies heavily on two other propositions. First, it notes, the doctrine of sovereign immunity requires that any statute authorizing the payment of fees and costs by the United States must be strictly construed. Ante, at 685-686. But this general statement does little to support the Court's position in this case. Congress clearly intended to authorize fees in certain circumstances, see n. 16, supra, and left it to the courts to ascertain which cases would be "appropriate."  [*707]  19Link to the text of the note [****47]   [**3289]  Second, the majority finds the relation between § 307(f) and § 304(d), a similarly worded Clean Air Act provision enacted in 1970, to be "instructive." Ante, at 691. 20Link to the text of the note I do not share the majority's interpretation of the significance of § 304(d).

As originally proposed in 1970, § 304(d) provided for attorney's fee awards "whenever the court determines such action is in the public interest." 21Link to the text of the note The Senate Report on that provision explained that the Committee intended to give courts the authority to award costs to defendants who had been harassed by frivolous litigation, and also to compensate citizens who performed a public service by bringing actions that successfully caused the defendant to abate an environmental violation "before a verdict is issued." 22Link to the text of the note  [***958]  Subsequently the  [*708]  language [****48]  was changed from "in the public interest" to "appropriate," without any apparent change in meaning.

 [****49]  It by no means follows, however, that Congress intended, by using the word "appropriate," to assure only that successful parties in these two situations would be eligible for fees. 23Link to the text of the note Indeed, such an interpretation is contradicted by the open-ended language used to describe § 304(d) in the section-by-section analysis in the same Senate Report. The Committee specifically stated: "The court may award costs of litigation to either party whenever the court determines such an award is in the public interest without regard to the outcome of the litigation." S. Rep. No. 91-1196, p. 65 (1970). The fact that attorney and expert witness fees were treated alike in § 304(d) corroborates this interpretation of the 1970 Act. A true expert witness can often provide valuable assistance to the finder of fact, even if the expert's ultimate conclusion is rejected or the party who offered the expert's testimony does not prevail.

When the [****50]  1977 Act was passed, Congress made clear that the courts had the power to award fees and costs in actions brought in the courts of appeals under § 307 as well as those filed in district courts under § 304. 24Link to the text of the note [****51]  As its citation to the  [*709]  1973 NRDC  [**3290]  opinion demonstrates, it also took into account post-1970 judicial developments in attorney's fees law. By 1977, if not before 1970, the case law had made clear that the authority to award fees to "prevailing parties" included the two situations specifically mentioned in the 1970 legislative history. 25Link to the text of the note [****52]  It was  [***959]  therefore not necessary to go beyond the  [*710]  "prevailing parties" standard to achieve the result petitioner now seeks to ascribe to Congress in 1977. Moreover, the "appropriate" standard in § 304(d) itself had been construed more broadly to permit awards to nonprevailing parties. 26Link to the text of the note

The majority's position is simple but illogical: Congress in 1977 used the term "whenever [the court of appeals] determines that such an award is appropriate" to mean when the plaintiff is a "prevailing party" or "partially prevailing party." Ante, at 689. It would have been much simpler for Congress to use the language "prevailing party" and "partially prevailing party" if that is precisely what it meant. Instead, it expressly rejected such language, 27Link to the text of the note which it had previously used in countless other statutes, see n. 12, supra, and chose to authorize the court to award fees "whenever it determines that such [****53]  an award is appropriate."

Accordingly, I cannot agree with the Court's interpretation of the statutory language. Congress decided that in exceptional circumstances it might be "appropriate" to award attorney's fees to nonprevailing parties. Of course, as the Court of Appeals recognized, it would be unreasonable to presume, against the background of attorney's fees statutes generally, that Congress intended fees to be awarded to every nonprevailing party who has litigated a nonfrivolous challenge to an EPA regulation. See 217 U. S. App. D. C., at 183, n. 4, 185, 189, n. 10, 672 F.2d, at 36, n. 4, 38, 42, n. 10.  [*711]  The degree of success or failure should certainly be weighed in the balance [****54]  to determine whether it is appropriate to require the Government to bear its adversary's  [**3291]  costs of litigation. In my view it would be an abuse of discretion for the Court of Appeals to award fees to a nonprevailing party unless its contribution to the process of judicial review, or to the implementation of the Act by the agency, had truly been substantial and had furthered the goals of the Clean Air Act.

As the Court of Appeals recognized in this case, § 307(f) requires the court to consider the importance, novelty, and complexity of the issues raised by the party seeking fees and costs. A fee award might well be inappropriate if the party had challenged an agency decision of narrow  [***960]  applicability, 28Link to the text of the note or if the party's contentions, though nonfrivolous, were relatively weak. In addition to the importance of the issues litigated by the party seeking attorney's fees, it would be appropriate for the court to consider whether the party had an economic incentive to participate in litigation because it stood to gain substantial economic benefits. If so, an award of fees would be inconsistent with congressional intent. Further, § 307(f), properly construed,  [****55]  permits the court of appeals to take into account the degree of technical and legal assistance the party provided to the court in its evaluation of the case. The court of appeals is in the best position to make these determinations, because it is uniquely familiar with the circumstances of each case. In order to assure a reasonable exercise of discretion, it should be required to explain with some care -- as the Court of Appeals has done in this case -- why it deems an award of fees to a nonprevailing party to be "appropriate."

Regardless of our views about the wisdom of the choice Congress made, we have a plain duty to accept it. TVA v.  [*712]  Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 194-195 (1978). [****56]  Congress consciously selected a particular course: that a party who seeks judicial review of an EPA regulation may be entitled to compensation from the Government, when the court deems it "appropriate," even if the reviewing court determines that there is no ground for disturbing the agency's conclusions. I would construe this category of "appropriate" cases to be narrow; it is wrong, however, to read it out of the statute altogether. It is not the function of the courts to "sit as a committee of review, nor are we vested with the power of veto." Ibid. 29Link to the text of the note

I therefore respectfully dissent.

The court's concluding discussion does not support petitioner's suggestion that "the court had no difficulty rejecting Sierra Club's construction of the statute." Brief for Petitioner 33, n. 21. The court wrote:

"We reach our decision after interminable record searching (and considerable soul searching). We have read the record with as hard a look as mortal judges can probably give its thousands of pages. We have adopted a simple and straight-forward standard of review, probed the agency's rationale, studied its references (and those of appellants), endeavored to understand them where they were intelligible (parts were simply impenetrable), and on close questions given the agency the benefit of the doubt out of deference for the terrible complexity of its job." 211 U.

The Court of Appeals made clear that it was adopting a stringent standard.

In the absence of statute, the general rule in America is that each party must pay the fees of his own counsel. Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975). This rule prevails in federal litigation unless Congress has otherwise provided. Congress has enacted a variety of different attorney's fees statutes. In various situations, it has provided that a fee award for the prevailing party is mandatory, see, e. g., 15 U. S. C. § 15 (1976 ed., Supp. V) (Clayton Act); that the court shall have authority to allow fees "in exceptional cases," see, e. g., 35 U. S. C. § 285 (patent cases); or that an award should normally be made to a successful plaintiff "absent exceptional circumstances," see, e. g., 42 U. S. C. § 1988 (1976 ed., Supp. V); Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983). Indeed, in one category of litigation -- criminal cases -- Congress has expressly mandated compensation for counsel for indigent defendants regardless of the outcome of the litigation. 18 U. S. C. § 3006A(d) (1976 ed. and Supp. V). "Under this scheme of things, it is apparent that the circumstances under which attorneys' fees are to be awarded and the range of discretion of the courts in making those awards are matters for Congress to determine."

S. C. § 18(f) (Commodity Exchange Act) ("If the petitioner finally prevails, he shall be allowed a reasonable attorney's fee, to be taxed and collected as a part of the costs of the suit"); 42 U. S. C. § 1973l(e) ("In any action or proceeding to enforce the voting guarantees of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs"); 42 U.

If one assumes, as apparently the Court does, that the word "appropriate" is ambiguous, ante, at 683, then I would think it necessary to examine the legislative history of each statute in which the word has been used in order to ascertain its meaning. The Court, however, relying on the legislative history of one statute, § 307(f) -- which actually points in the other direction -- concludes that all 16 other statutes limit fee awards to prevailing parties. Ante, at 682-683, n. 1.

See 3 Legislative History of the Clean Air Amendments of 1977 (Committee Print compiled for the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 95-16, p. 688 (1978) (1977 Leg. Hist.). See 5 id., at 3644 (S. 252, introduced Jan. 14, 1977); 122 Cong. Rec. 23834 (1976) (remarks of Sen. Buckley). Written comments submitted to the Senate Committee on behalf of the Edison Electric Institute observed that the fees provision of S. 252, limited to parties that prevailed at least in part, was "less sweeping" than language in S. 253, which would "permit the court to award costs of litigation whenever it feels such award is appropriate." 5 1977 Leg. Hist., at 4146-4147. Before reporting S. 252 to the Senate floor, the Committee struck out the "prevailing party" language and substituted the "appropriate" test. 3 id., at 573-575, 688.

The Clean Air Act Amendments passed by the Senate the previous year, S. 3219, had similarly required an award of fees for prevailing parties and further provided that, in any case "in which such party prevails in part, the court shall have discretion to award such reasonable costs." S. 3219, § 35, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. (1976), 6 1977 Leg. Hist., at 4689. At conference, however, the House version -- providing for an award of fees in "appropriate" cases -- was adopted. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 94-1742, pp. 115-116 (1976), 5 1977 Leg. Hist., at 4400-4401; id., at 6071 (text of conference bill, H. R. 10498). The conference bill was not enacted by Congress in 1976, but the 1976 legislative history buttresses the conclusion that Congress consciously chose the "appropriate" standard rather than the "prevailing party" standard when it enacted amendments to the Clean Air Act a year later.

The Report added: "In adopting this provision concerning fees, the committee intended to meet the requirement for specific authorization imposed by 28 U. S. C. sec. 2412 and by the Supreme Court's ruling in Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240 (1975)." H. R. Rep. No. 95-294, at 337, 4 1977 Leg. Hist., at 2804. The entire passage appeared in identical form in the House Report regarding the Clean Air Act amendments passed by the House in 1976. H. R. Rep. No. 94-1175, p. 277 (1976), 7 1977 Leg.

The majority places considerable weight on the statement made in a Staff Report that language actually adopted in § 307(f) was "narrower" than the rejected formulation. Ante, at 691. If the Staff Report was actually referring to § 307(f), its view would be inconsistent with the position of the House Committee, surely a more reliable source of congressional intent. But in fact, I think the majority misinterprets the Staff Report, which stated:

"The conference report [§ 307(f)] contained a narrower House provision. It authorized but did not require, courts to award reasonable attorneys fees to any party against whom EPA acted unreasonably in initiating an enforcement action. The award of attorneys fees was also authorized in judicial review proceedings brought under section 307 of the Clean Air Act." Section-by-Section Analysis of S. 252 and S. 253, Prepared by the Staff of the Subcommittee on Environmental Pollution of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, Ser. No. 95-1, p. 37 (Comm. Print 1977), 5 1977 Leg. Hist., at 3893.

The "narrower House provision" seems to be the provision for awarding fees to the targets of unreasonable EPA enforcement actions. This section was codified as part of § 113(b), 42 U. S. C. § 7413(b) (1976 ed., Supp. V) -- not as part of § 307(f). See 5 1977 Leg. Hist., at 4354.

Thus our discussion in Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 61, 69 (1955), is fully apposite here: "Of course, when dealing with a statute subjecting the Government to liability for potentially great sums of money, this Court must not promote profligacy by careless construction. Neither should it as a self-appointed guardian of the Treasury import immunity back into a statute designed to limit it." See Canadian Aviator, Ltd. v. United States, 324 U.S. 215, 222-226 (1945) (refusing to interpret an Act authorizing suits against the United States as narrowly as the Government suggested, because "we think Congressional adoption of broad statutory language authorizing suit was deliberate and is not to be thwarted by an unduly restrictive interpretation").

Section § 304(d), 42 U. S. C. § 7604(d) (1976 ed. and Supp. V), provides for fee awards in citizens' suits brought in federal district court against alleged violators or against the EPA Administrator seeking enforcement of the Clean Air Act:

"The court, in issuing any final order in any action brought pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert witness (fees) to any party, whenever the court determines such award is appropriate."

"The Committee has added a key element in providing that the courts may award costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees, whenever the court determines that such action is in the public interest. The court could thus award costs of litigation to defendants where the litigation was obviously frivolous or harassing. This should have the effect of discouraging abuse of this provision, while at the same time encouraging the quality of the actions that will be brought.

"The Courts should recognize that in bringing legitimate actions under this section citizens would be performing a public service and in such instances the courts should award costs of litigation to such party. This should extend to plaintiffs in actions which result in successful abatement but do not reach a verdict. For instance, if as a result of a citizen proceeding and before a verdict is issued, a defendant abated a violation, the court may award litigation expenses borne by the plaintiffs in prosecuting such actions." S. Rep. No. 91-1196, p. 38 (1970).

The word "appropriate," however, may well have different meanings in § 304 suits, which serve the primary function of aiding in the abatement of air pollution by stimulating enforcement of standards and regulations under the Clean Air Act, and in § 307 suits, which challenge the validity of air pollution standards promulgated by the agency. The reference in the 1970 legislative history to abatement of a violation before judgment in litigation, for example, has no direct applicability to § 307 actions seeking judicial review. In addition, private parties may be defendants in § 304 actions but not in § 307 judicial review proceedings. I do not believe it would be appropriate for a court to require a private defendant to pay the attorney's fees of an unsuccessful plaintiff in a § 304 suit, and of course, the possibility would never arise in a § 307 action. Thus, the Court's discussion, ante, at 691-692, has the same heroic quality as Don Quixote's defense against the charge of the windmills.

Petitioner concedes that, before and during 1977, "prevailing parties" included plaintiffs who obtained favorable settlements rather than litigated judgments. See Brief for Petitioner 20-21, n. 13 (citing four 1976 civil rights cases, three FOIA cases decided in 1976 and one in 1977). Indeed, even before the 1970 Act was passed, the "prevailing party" standard had not always been construed narrowly to exclude such plaintiffs. See Parham v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 433 F.2d 421, 429-430 (CA8 1970) (plaintiff whose Title VII suit acted as a "catalyst" prompting the defendant company to change its discriminatory employment policies was entitled to attorney's fees as a "prevailing party" even though he received no individual remedy and no injunctive relief was granted to the class); Corcoran v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 121 F.2d 575, 576 (CA9 1941) (under copyright statute, limiting attorney's fees to a "prevailing party," the court had power to allow fees when the defendant obtained a court order for the clarification of the complaint and the plaintiff then voluntarily dismissed without amending his pleading).

The majority suggests, however, that Congress decided not to adopt the "prevailing party" standard because it was aware of cases denying "prevailing party" status unless the plaintiff had prevailed "as to a substantial part of the litigation" or had succeeded on the "central issue." Ante, at 688. But the House Report's citation of Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 484 F.2d 1331 (CA1 1973), casts doubt on that contention.
