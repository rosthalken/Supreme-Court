Even though I have not changed the views I expressed in Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 198; Smith v. United States, 431 U.S. 291, 311-321;     and Splawn v. California, 431 U.S. 595, 602-605, I do not believe that I have the authority to vote to modify the judgment below on a ground not fairly subsumed within the question presented by the petition for certiorari. *Link to the text of the note That question is whether conviction by a nonunanimous     six-person jury of a nonpetty offense violates the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Because this is the only question addressed by the Court and because I agree with the Court's resolution of this question, I join its opinion.

See this Court's Rule 23 (1)(c) ("Only the questions set forth in the petition or fairly comprised therein will be considered by the court"); Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 208, and n. 6; General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co., 304 U.S. 175, 177-179.
