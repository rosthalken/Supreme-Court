Supreme Court of the United States
PENNSYLVANIA, Petitioner,
v.
Inocencio MUNIZ.
No. 89–213.
|
Argued Feb. 27, 1990.
|
Decided June 18, 1990.
Chief Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Justice WHITE, Justice BLACKMUN, and Justice STEVENS join, concurring in part, concurring in the result in part, and dissenting in part.

I join Parts I, II, III–A, and IV of the Court’s opinion. In addition, although I **2653 agree with the conclusion in Part III–C that the seven “booking” questions should not be suppressed, I do so for a reason different from that of Justice BRENNAN. I dissent from the Court’s conclusion that Muniz’s response to the “sixth birthday question” should have been suppressed.
 
The Court holds that the sixth birthday question Muniz was asked required a testimonial response, and that its admission at trial therefore violated Muniz’s privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. The Court says:
“When Officer Hosterman asked Muniz if he knew the date of his sixth birthday and Muniz, for whatever reason, could not remember or calculate that date, he was confronted with the trilemma [i.e., the ‘ “trilemma” of truth, falsity, or silence,’ see ante, at 2648].... Muniz was left with the choice of incriminating himself by admitting that he did not then know the date of his sixth birthday, or answering untruthfully by reporting a date that he did not then believe to be accurate (an incorrect guess would be incriminating as well as untruthful).” Ante, at 2649.
As an assumption about human behavior, this statement is wrong. Muniz would no more have felt compelled to fabricate a false date than one who cannot read the letters on an eye chart feels compelled to fabricate false letters; nor does a wrong guess call into question a speaker’s veracity. The Court’s statement is also a flawed predicate on which to base its conclusion that Muniz’s answer to this question was “testimonial” for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.
 
*607 The need for the use of the human voice does not automatically make an answer testimonial, United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 222–223, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1929–1930, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), any more than does the fact that a question calls for the exhibition of one’s handwriting in written characters. Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 266–267, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 1953–1954, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967). In Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), we held that the extraction and chemical analysis of a blood sample involved no “shadow of testimonial compulsion upon or enforced communication by the accused.” Id., at 765, 86 S.Ct., at 1832. All of these holdings were based on Justice Holmes’ opinion in Holt v. United States, 218 U.S. 245, 31 S.Ct. 2, 54 L.Ed. 1021 (1910), where he said for the Court that “the prohibition of compelling a man in a criminal court to be witness against himself is a prohibition of the use of physical or moral compulsion to extort communications from him, not an exclusion of his body as evidence when it may be material.” Id., at 252–253, 31 S.Ct., at 6.
 
The sixth birthday question here was an effort on the part of the police to check how well Muniz was able to do a simple mathematical exercise. Indeed, had the question related only to the date of his birth, it presumably would have come under the “booking exception” to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), to which the Court refers elsewhere in its opinion. The Court holds in this very case that Muniz may be required to perform a “horizontal gaze nystagmus” test, the “walk and turn” test, and the “one leg stand” test, all of which are designed to test a suspect’s physical coordination. If the police may require Muniz to use his body in order to demonstrate the level of his physical coordination, there is no reason why they should not be able to require him to speak or write in order to determine his mental coordination. That was all that was sought here. Since it was permissible for the police to extract and examine a sample of Schmerber’s blood to determine how much that part of his system had been affected by alcohol, I see no reason why they may not examine the functioning of Muniz’s mental processes for the same purpose.
 
*608 Surely if it were relevant, a suspect might be asked to take an eye examination in the course of which he might have to admit that he could not read the letters on the third **2654 line of the chart. At worst, he might utter a mistaken guess. Muniz likewise might have attempted to guess the correct response to the sixth birthday question instead of attempting to calculate the date or answer “I don’t know.” But the potential for giving a bad guess does not subject the suspect to the truth-falsity-silence predicament that renders a response testimonial and, therefore, within the scope of the Fifth Amendment privilege.
 
For substantially the same reasons, Muniz’s responses to the videotaped “booking” questions were not testimonial and do not warrant application of the privilege. Thus, it is unnecessary to determine whether the questions fall within the “routine booking question” exception to Miranda Justice BRENNAN recognizes.
 
I would reverse in its entirety the judgment of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania. But given the fact that five members of the Court agree that Muniz’s response to the sixth birthday question should have been suppressed, I agree that the judgment of the Superior Court should be vacated so that, on remand, the court may consider whether admission of the response at trial was harmless error.
 



1
The sixth birthday question also clearly constituted custodial interrogation because it was a form of “express questioning.” Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 300–301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1689, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980). Furthermore, that question would not fall within Justice BRENNAN's proposed routine booking question exception. The question serves no apparent recordkeeping need, as the police already possessed Muniz's date of birth. The absence of any administrative need for the question, moreover, suggests that the question was designed to obtain an incriminating response. Regardless of any administrative need for the question and regardless of the officer's intent, Miranda warnings were required because the police should have known that the question was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. Supra, at 2642–2643.
2
An additional factor strongly suggests that the police expected Muniz to make incriminating statements. Pursuant to their routine in such cases, App. 28–29, the police allotted 20 minutes for the three sobriety tests and for “observation.” Because Muniz finished the tests in approximately 6 minutes, the police required him to wait another 14 minutes before they asked him to submit to the breathalyzer examination. Given the absence of any apparent technical or administrative reason for the delay and the stated purpose of “observing” Muniz, the delay appears to have been designed in part to give Muniz the opportunity to make incriminating statements.

The Commonwealth could not use Muniz's failure to count against him regardless of whether his silence during the walk and turn test was itself testimonial in those circumstances. Cf. ante, at 2651, n. 17. A defendant's silence in response to police questioning is not admissible at trial even if the silence is not, in the particular circumstances, a form of communicative conduct. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 468, n. 37, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1624, n. 37, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) (“[I]t is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation. The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation”). Cf. Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 1233, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965) ( “[T]he Fifth Amendment ... forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused's silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt”).
4
I continue to have serious reservations about the Court's limitation of the Fifth Amendment privilege to “testimonial” evidence. See United States v. Mara, 410 U.S. 19, 32–38, 93 S.Ct. 774, 781–784, 35 L.Ed.2d 99 (1973) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). I believe that privilege extends to any evidence that a person is compelled to furnish against himself. Id., at 33–35, 93 S.Ct., at 782–783. At the very least, the privilege includes evidence that can be obtained only through the person's affirmative cooperation. Id., at 36–37, 93 S.Ct., at 783–784. Of course, a person's refusal to incriminate himself also cannot be used against him. See n. 3, supra. Muniz's performance of the sobriety tests and his refusal to take the breathalyzer examination are thus protected by the Fifth Amendment under this interpretation. But cf. ante, at 2652, n. 19. Because Muniz does not challenge the admission of the video portion of the videotape showing the sobriety tests or of his refusal to take the breathalyzer examination, however, those issues are not before this Court.
