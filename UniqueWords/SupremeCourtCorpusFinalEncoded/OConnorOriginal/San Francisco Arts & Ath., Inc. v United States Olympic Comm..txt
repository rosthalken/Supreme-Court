JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I agree with the Court's construction of § 110 of the Amateur Sports Act, 92 Stat. 3048, 36 U. S. C. § 380, and with its holding that the statute is "within constitutional bounds." Ante, at 535. Therefore, I join Parts I through III of the Court's opinion.  [1157]  But largely for the reasons explained by JUSTICE BRENNAN in Part I-B of his dissenting opinion, I believe the United States Olympic Committee and the United States are joint participants in the challenged activity and as such are subject to the equal protection provisions of the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly, I would reverse the Court  [***456]  of Appeals' finding of no Government action and remand the case for determination of petitioners' claim of discriminatory enforcement.
