Justice Breyer, respecting the denial of the application for stay and the denial of certiorari.

This case reflects the special circumstances of trying to execute a person who has been on death row for 30 years and has cancer. As I have previously written, rather than develop a “constitutional jurisprudence that focuses upon the special circumstances of the aged,” I would reconsider the constitutionality of the death penalty itself. Dunn v. Madison, 583 U. S. ___, ___, 38 S. Ct. 9, 199 L. Ed. 2d 243 (2017) (Breyer, J., concurring).
