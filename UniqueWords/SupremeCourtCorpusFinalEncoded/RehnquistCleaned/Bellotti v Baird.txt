
I join the opinion of Mr. Justice POWELL and the judgment of the Court. At **3053 such time as this Court is willing to *652 reconsider its earlier decision inPlanned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976), in which I joined the opinion of Mr. Justice WHITE, dissenting in part, I shall be more than willing to participate in that task. But unless and until that time comes, literally thousands of judges cannot be left with nothing more than the guidance offered by a truly fragmented holding of this Court.
