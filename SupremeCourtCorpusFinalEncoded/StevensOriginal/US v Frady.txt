JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.

Although my view of the relevance of the cause for counsel's failure to object to a jury instruction is  [***835]  significantly different from the Court's, see Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 94-97 (STEVENS, J., concurring); Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 538 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Engle v. Isaac, ante, at 136-137, n. 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), I have joined the Court's opinion in this case because it properly focuses on the character of the prejudice to determine whether collateral relief is appropriate.
