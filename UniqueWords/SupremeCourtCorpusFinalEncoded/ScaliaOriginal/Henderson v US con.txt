Supreme Court of the United States
Lloyd HENDERSON, Petitioner,
v.
UNITED STATES.
No. 95–232.
|
Argued March 19, 1996.
|
Decided May 20, 1996.

Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice KENNEDY joins, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court. I write separately to make clear that it is not my view, and I do not understand the Court to hold, that no procedural provision can be jurisdictional. It assuredly is within the power of Congress to condition its waiver of sovereign immunity upon strict compliance with procedural provisions attached to the waiver, with the result that failure to comply will deprive a court of *673 jurisdiction. For the reasons stated by the Court, I do not think that the legislative scheme here makes the “forthwith” service requirement such a condition.
