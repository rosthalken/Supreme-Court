These cases, along with other decisions and the holding in Salerno itself (that the challenged Act was constitutional in most circumstances, not merely one), should have braced the dissent against the minor risk of whiplash from the "head-snapping" observation, post, at 5, that our "doctrinal pattern is somewhat more complex" than Salerno's "no circumstance" language suggests, Fallon, Making Sense of Overbreadth, 100 Yale L. J. 853, 859, n. 29 (1991) (citing cases).
   
2 In all likelihood, the decision of the Fifth Circuit applying the "no circumstance" test would have been decided the same way even if that court had utilized the "large fraction" test applied by the Eighth Circuit in this case. See Barnes v. Moore, 970 F.2d 12, 14 (CA5 1992) (noting that the provisions at issue were "substantially identical" to provisions upheld in Casey).
Furthermore, it is not at all clear to me, given intervening statements by Members of this Court, see Fargo Women's Health Organization v. Schafer, 507 U.S. 1013, 1014, 123 L. Ed. 2d 285, 113 S. Ct. 1668 (1993), that subsequent Fifth Circuit panels would follow Barnes' application of the "no circumstance" test, providing yet another reason to deny the petition in this case.
