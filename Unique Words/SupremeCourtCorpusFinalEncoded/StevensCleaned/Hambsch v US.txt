There are times when it is important to emphasize the fact that an order denying a petition for a writ of certiorari is not a ruling on the merits of any question presented by the petition. See Singleton v. Commissioner, 439 U.S. 940, 942 (1978) (STEVENS, J., respecting denial of petition for writ of certiorari). In my opinion, this is such an occasion.
