In my view, there is not a fair prospect that a majority of this Court would find the decision below erroneous. "Congress has limited the jurisdiction of the Courts of Appeals to 'final decisions of the district courts.' 28 U. S. C. § 1291. This Court has long held that the policy of Congress embodied in this statute is inimical to piecemeal appellate review of trial court decisions which do not terminate the litigation, and that this policy is at its strongest in the field of criminal law." United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458 U.S. 263, 264-265 (1982). It is clear that the District Court's denial of applicant's motion to dismiss did not terminate the litigation. Although applicant claims that his challenge to the constitutionality    of the Act is sufficiently collateral to fall within the limited exception enumerated in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949), I do not think the exception covers this case. "If [applicant's] principle were to be applied, questions as to the constitutionality of the statutes authorizing the prosecution and doubtless numerous other questions would fall under such a definition, and the policy against piecemeal appeals in criminal cases would be swallowed by ever-multiplying exceptions." Hollywood    Motor Car, supra, at 270. There will be time enough for applicant to present his constitutional claim to the appellate courts if and when he is convicted of the charges against him.
Accordingly, the application for a stay and recall of the mandate of the Court of Appeals is
Denied.
