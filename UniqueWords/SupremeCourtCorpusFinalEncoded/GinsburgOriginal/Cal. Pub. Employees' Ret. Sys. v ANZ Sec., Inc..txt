Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.

A class complaint was filed against respondents well within the three-year period of repose set out in §13 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U. S. C. §77m. That complaint informed respondents of the substance of the claims asserted against them and the identities of potential claimants. See American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538, 554-555, 94 S. Ct. 756, 38 L. Ed. 2d 713 (1974); Crown, Cork & Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U. S. 345, 353, 103 S. Ct. 2392, 76 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1983). Respondents, in other words, received what §13’s repose period was designed to afford them: notice of their potential liability within a fixed time window.

The complaint also “commence[d] the action for all members of the class.” American Pipe, 414 U. S., at 550, 94 S. Ct. 756, 38 L. Ed. 2d 713. Thus, when petitioner California [***33]  Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) elected to exercise the right safeguarded by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2)(B)(v), i.e., the right to opt out of the class and proceed independently, CalPERS’ claim  [**600]  remained timely. See American Pipe, 414 U. S., at 550, 94 S. Ct. 756, 38 L. Ed. 2d 713 (demanding that class members “individually meet the timeliness requirements . . . is simply inconsistent with Rule 23”). Given the due process underpinning of the opt-out right, see Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. 338, 363, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011), I resist rendering the right illusory for CalPERS and similarly situated class members. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Second Circuit. Accordingly, I dissent from today’s decision, under which opting out cuts off any chance for recovery.



I
CalPERS’ claim against respondents was timely launched when the class representative filed a complaint pursuant to §11 of the Securities Act, 15 U. S. C. §77k, on behalf of all members of the described class, CalPERS among them. See American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538, 550, 94 S. Ct. 756, 38 L. Ed. 2d 713 (1974) (under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, “the filing of a timely class action complaint commences the action for all members of the class”). See also ante, at ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 590 .(CalPERS was part of putative class) Filing the class complaint within three years of the date the securities specified in that complaint were offered to the public also satisfied §13’s statute of repose. As the Court observes, ante, at ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 591, statutes of [***34]  repose “effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should be free from [facing] liability after the legislatively determined period of time.” CTS Corp. v. Waldburger, 573 U. S. ___, ___-___, 134 S. Ct. 2175, 2183, 189 L. Ed. 2d 62, 73 (2014) ) (internal quotation marks omitted). A repose period assures a party who might be drawn into litigation that, if no action is brought within a specified time, he will be off the hook. But whether CalPERS stayed in the class or eventually filed separately, respondents would have known, within the repose period, of their potential liability to all putative class members.

A class complaint “notifies the defendants not only of the substantive claims being brought against them, but also of the number and generic identities of the potential  [*2057]  plaintiffs who may participate in the judgment.” Crown, Cork & Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U. S. 345, 353, 103 S. Ct. 2392, 76 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1983) (quoting American Pipe, 414 U. S., at 555, 94 S. Ct. 756, 38 L. Ed. 2d 713). The class complaint filed against respondents provided that very notice: It identified “the essential information necessary to determine both the subject matter and size of the prospective litigation,” id., at 555, 94 S. Ct. 756, 38 L. Ed. 2d 713i.e., the class of plaintiffs, the offering documents, and the alleged untrue statements and misleading omissions in those documents, see App. 50-66. “[A] defendant faced with [such] information about a potential liability to a class cannot be said [***35]  to have reached a state of repose that should be protected.” Developments in the Law: Class Actions, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1318, 1451 (1976).

When CalPERS elected to pursue individually the claims already stated in the class complaint against the same defendants, it simply took control of the piece of the action that had always belonged to it. CalPERS’ statement of the same allegations in an individual complaint could not disturb anyone’s repose, for respondents  [**601]  could hardly be at rest once notified of the potential claimants and the precise false or misleading statements alleged to infect the registration statements at issue. 1Link to the text of the note CalPERS’ decision to opt out did change two things: (1) CalPERS positioned itself to exercise its constitutional right to go it alone, cutting loose from a monetary settlement it deemed insufficient; and (2) respondents had to deal with CalPERS and its attorneys in addition to the named plaintiff and class counsel. Although those changes may affect how litigation subsequently plays out, see ante, at ___ - ___, 198 L. Ed. 2d, at 596-597, they do not implicate the concerns that prompted §13’s repose period: The class complaint disclosed the same information respondents would have received had each class member instead filed an individual complaint [***36]  on the day the class complaint was filed.



II
Today’s decision disserves the investing public that §11 was designed to protect. The harshest consequences will fall on those class members, often least sophisticated, who fail to file a protective claim within the repose period. Absent a protective claim filed within that period, those members stand to forfeit their constitutionally shielded right to opt out of the class and thereby control the prosecution of their own claims for damages. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. 338, 363, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011) (“In the context of a class action predominantly for money damages,” the “absence of . . . opt-out violates due process.”). Because critical stages of securities class actions, including the class-certification decision, often occur years after the filing of a class complaint, 2Link to the text of the note the risk is high that class members failing to file a protective claim will be saddled with inadequate representation or an inadequate judgment.

 [*2058]  The majority’s ruling will also gum up the works of class litigation. Defendants will have an incentive to slow walk discovery and other precertification proceedings so the clock will run on potential opt outs. Any class member with a material stake in a §11 case, including every fiduciary [***37]  who must safeguard investor assets, will have strong cause to file a protective claim, in a separate complaint or in a motion to intervene, before the three-year period expires. See Brief for Retired Federal Judges as Amici Curiae 9-14. Such filings, by increasing the costs and complexity of the litigation, “substantially burden the courts.” Id., at 13.

Today’s decision impels courts and class counsel to take on a more active role in protecting class members’ opt-out rights. See id., at 11-13. As the repose period nears expiration, it should be incumbent on class counsel, guided by district courts, to notify  [**602]  class members about the consequences of failing to file a timely protective claim. “At minimum, when notice goes out to a class beyond [§13’s limitations period], a district court will need to assess whether the notice [should] alert class members that opting out . . . would end [their] chance for recovery.” Id., at 20.



***
For the reasons stated, I would hold that the filing of the class complaint commenced CalPERS’ action under §11 of the Securities Act, thereby satisfying §13’s statute of repose. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Second Circuit.
