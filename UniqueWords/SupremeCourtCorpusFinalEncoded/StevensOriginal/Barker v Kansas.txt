KEYTON E. BARKER AND PAULINE BARKER, ET AL., PEITTIONERS v. KANSAS, ET AL.

No. 91-611 

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

503 U.S. 594

March 3, 1992, Argued 
April 21, 1992, Decided 

JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, concurring.
While I agree with the Court's explanation of why this case is controlled by Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 103 L. Ed. 2d 891, 109 S. Ct. 1500 (1989), I remain convinced that that case seriously  [*606]  misapplied the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity. A state tax burden that is shared equally by federal retirees and the vast majority of the State's citizens does not discriminate against those retirees. See id., at 823-824 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). The Federal Government has a legitimate interest in protecting its employees from disparate treatment, but federal judges should not be able to claim a tax exemption simply because a State decides to give such a benefit to the members of its judiciary instead of raising their salaries. I write separately to make this point because what I regard as this Court's perverse application of the non-discrimination principle is subject to review and correction by Congress. See Prudential Insurance Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U.S. 408, 90 L. Ed. 1342, 66 S. Ct. 1142 (1946).
