
Montana's experience, and experience elsewhere since this Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC,     558 U. S. ___, 558 U.S. 310, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010), make it exceedingly difficult to maintain that independent expenditures by corporations "do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption." 130 S. Ct. at 884, 175 L. Ed. 2d at 766 ). A petition for certiorari will give the Court an opportunity to consider whether, in light of the huge sums currently deployed to buy candidates' allegiance,    Citizens United should continue to hold sway. Because lower courts is bound to follow this Court's decisions until they are withdrawn or modified, however, Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484, 109 S. Ct. 1917, 104 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1989), I vote to grant the stay.
