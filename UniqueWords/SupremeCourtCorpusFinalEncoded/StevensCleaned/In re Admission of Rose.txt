
If the CHIEF JUSTICE is correct in his opinion that the question "whether an applicant appears 'to be of good moral and professional character' is a matter for this Court to decide independently," post, at 3-4, then the Court should take steps to provide an applicant a fair hearing on that question. Until such steps are taken, I shall continue to rely on the actions of the respective state bars and state courts, for they are in a much better position than we are to judge the character and fitness of their own practitioners. Rubber-stamp approval of the certification by the highest court in a State is not likely to cause any serious harm to anyone. The same cannot be said, however, for ad hoc, ex parte evaluation of an applicant's character.
