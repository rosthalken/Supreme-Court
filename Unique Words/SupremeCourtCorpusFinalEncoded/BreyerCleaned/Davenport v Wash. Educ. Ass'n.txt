
I agree with the Court that the Supreme Court of Washington's decision rested entirely on flawed interpretations of this Court's agency-fee    cases and our decision in BSA v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 120 S. Ct. 2446, 147 L. Ed. 2d 554 (2000). I therefore concur in the Court's judgment, and I join Parts I and II-A and the second paragraph of footnote 2 of the Court's opinion. However, I do not join Part II-B, which addresses numerous arguments that respondent Washington Education Association raised for the first time in its briefs before this Court. See, e.g.,    State ex rel. Wash. State Public Disclosure Comm'n v. Wash. Ed. Assn., 156 Wn. 2d 543, 565, n. 6, 130 P. 3d 352, 362, n. 6, (2006) (en banc) (noting that one of these arguments was neither raised nor addressed below). I would not address those arguments until the lower courts have been given the opportunity to address them. See, e.g., NCAA v. Smith, 525 U.S. 459, 469-470, 119 S. Ct. 924, 142 L. Ed. 2d 929 (1999).
