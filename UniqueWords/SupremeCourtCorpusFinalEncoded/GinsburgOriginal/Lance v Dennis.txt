JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins, concurring.

I agree in full with the Court's correction of the District Court's Rooker-Feldman error, and therefore join the Court's opinion. Although JUSTICE STEVENS has persuasively urged that issue preclusion warrants affirmance, see post, at 468-469, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1059 (dissenting opinion), that question of Colorado law seems to me best left for full airing and decision on remand.
