UNITED STATES AND FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION, PETITIONERS v. EDGE BROADCASTING COMPANY T/A POWER 94

No. 92-486

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

113 S. Ct. 2696

April 21, 1993, Argued 
June 25, 1993, Decided

JUSTICE SOUTER, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY joins, concurring in part.
I agree with the Court that the restriction at issue here is constitutional under our decision in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U.S. 557, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341, 100 S. Ct. 2343 (1980), even if that restriction is judged "as applied to Edge itself." Ante, at 431. I accordingly believe it unnecessary to decide whether the restriction might appropriately be reviewed at a more lenient level of generality, and I take no position on that question.
