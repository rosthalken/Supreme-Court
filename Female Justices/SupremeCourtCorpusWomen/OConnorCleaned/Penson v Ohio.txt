
I join the Court's opinion. I write separately to emphasize that nothing in the Court's opinion forecloses the possibility that a mere technical violation of Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), might be excusable. The violation in this case was not a mere technical violation, however, and on that understanding I concur.
