
I join Justice WHITE’s opinion with the exception of the paragraph in Part II headed **1142 “Third.” It does not seem to me “especially significant that the law enforcement officials possessed objective data indicating that the barn was not being used for intimate activities of the home.” Ante, at 1140. What is significant is that the barn was not being so used, whether or not the law enforcement officials knew it. The officers’ perceptions might be relevant to whether intrusion upon curtilage was nevertheless reasonable, but they are no more relevant to whether the barn was curtilage than to whether the house was a house.
