MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.

Only a few simple facts are relevant to the question of law presented by this case. 1Link to the text of the note At the time of petitioner's offense, there was no constitutional procedure for imposing the death penalty in Florida. Several months after his offense, Florida enacted the death penalty statute that was upheld in Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U.S. 242.  [****35]  Before this statute was passed, as a matter of Florida law, the crime committed by petitioner was not a capital offense. 2Link to the text of the note2 It is undisputed, therefore, that a law passed after the offense is the source of Florida's power to put petitioner to death.

 [*305]   [****36]  The Court holds that Florida may apply this law to petitioner without violating the Post Facto Clause.3Link to the text of the note In its view, the unconstitutional law which was on the Florida statute books at the time of the offense "clearly indicated Florida's view of the severity of murder and of the degree of punishment which the legislature wished to impose upon murderers." Ante, at 297. The Court concludes that the "fair warning" provided by the invalid statute "was sufficient compliance with the ex post facto provision of the United States Constitution." Ante, at 298. 4Link to the text of the note

 [****37]  This  [***364]  conclusion represents a clear departure from the test the Court has applied in past cases construing the Ex Post Facto Clause. That test was stated in Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U.S. 397, 401, in language that might have been written with the present case in mind: S

"The Constitution forbids the application of any new punitive measure to a crime already consummated, to the detriment or material disadvantage of the wrongdoer." 5Link to the text of the noteI

Applying that test in Lindsey, the Court held that even though  [*306]  the statute in effect at the time of the crime authorized a sentence of 15 years in the discretion of the trial judge, that sentence could not be imposed pursuant to a new mandatory sentencing statute. Notwithstanding the defendant's "fair warning" of the possible 15-year  [**2305]  sentence, the Court held that the change in the standard of punishment could not be retroactively applied to him.6Link to the text of the note The change was invalid simply  [*307]  because the new standard increased  [***365]  the probability of a severe sentence. In the case before us, the new standard created the possibility of a death sentence that could not have been lawfully imposed when the offense was committed. A more [****38]  dramatically different standard of punishment is difficult to envision.

 [****39]  We should adhere to the Lindsey test. Fair warning cannot be the touchstone, for two reasons. First, "fair warning" does not provide a workable test for deciding particular cases. Second, as Mr. Justice Harlan has explained, 7Link to the text of the note fair notice is not the only important value underlying the constitutional prohibition; the Ex Post Facto Clause also provides a basic protection against improperly motivated or capricious legislation. 8Link to the text of the note It ensures that the sovereign will govern impartially  [*308]  and that it will be  [**2306]  perceived as doing so. The Court's "fair warning" test, if it extends beyond this case, would allow government action that is just the opposite of impartial. If that be so, the "fair warning" rationale will defeat the very purpose of the Clause.

 [****40]  By what standard is the fairness of the warning contained in an unconstitutional statute to be judged? Is an itinerant, who may not have the slightest notion of what Florida's statute books contain, to be judged differently from a local lawyer? The assumption that the former has "fair warning" can only rest on the somewhat unrealistic presumption that everyone is deemed to know the law. But it is not words in statute books that constitute the law. If citizens are bound to know the law, "they [are] bound to know it as we have expounded it." Kring v. Missouri, 107 U.S. 221, 235.  [***366]  A consistent application of that presumption would require the conclusion that neither the lawyer nor the itinerant had fair warning because both must also be presumed to know that the old Florida statute was a nullity. The Court's test cannot fairly be applied on the basis of a particular individual's actual knowledge of the law; if applied on the basis of a presumed knowledge of the law, it requires that this death sentence be vacated.

 [*309]  As applied to pre-Furman death penalty statutes, the Court's test is dramatically inadequate. The Court makes the assumption that the "existence [****41]  on the statute books" of the pre-Furman statute provided "fair warning" to petitioner "of the penalty which Florida would seek to impose on him if he were convicted of first-degree murder." Ante, at 297, 298. On the contrary, capital punishment at the time of Furman had "for all practical purposes run its course." Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 313 (WHITE, J., concurring). The death penalty at that time was "freakishly imposed" and "cruel and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightning is cruel and unusual." Id., at 310, 309 (STEWART, J., concurring). The possibility of such capricious punishment is not "fair warning," under any meaningful use of those words.

If the Court's rationale is applicable to all cases in which a State replaces an unconstitutional death penalty statute with a subsequent statute, it is dramatically at odds with the common understanding of the meaning of the Clause. That understanding was most plainly revealed by the nationwide response to this Court's invalidation of the death penalty in Furman v. Georgia, supra. Of the hundreds of prisoners on death row at the time of that decision, none was resentenced to [****42]  death. Each of those persons, at the time of his offense, had precisely the same "fair warning" as this petitioner. But our state courts and state legislatures uniformly acted on the assumption that none of them could be executed pursuant to a subsequently enacted statute. Under the "fair warning" rationale the Court adopts today, there was, and is, no such constitutional barrier.

If I am correct that the Ex Post Facto Clause was intended as a barrier to capricious government action, today's holding is actually perverse. For when human life is at stake, the need to prevent capricious punishment is greatest, as our decisions in Furman and Proffitt establish. Cf. Skinner v. Oklahoma ex  [*310]  rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535. Yet the Court's holding may lead to results which are intolerably arbitrary. For example, the  [**2307]  trial in Miller v. State, 332 So. 2d 65 (Fla. 1976), was delayed by the defendant's incompetence to stand trial. By the time his capacity was restored, Florida had enacted its new death penalty statute. Had it not been for his fortuitous illness, defendant would have been tried promptly and escaped the death penalty. Because  [****43]  of a delay over which he had no control, the enactment of an ex post facto statute was held to entitle the State to put him to death. The capricious consequence is particularly grotesque because Miller may well have been advised before trial that  [***367]  this Court's decision in Furman had removed the possibility of a death sentence. 9Link to the text of the note

Because a logical application of the Court's "fair warning" rationale would lead to such manifestly intolerable results, 10Link to the text of the note  [*311]  I assume that this case will ultimately be regarded [****44]  as nothing more than an archaic gargoyle. It is nevertheless distressing to witness such a demeaning construction of a majestic bulwark in the framework of our Constitution.

 [****45]  I respectfully dissent.
