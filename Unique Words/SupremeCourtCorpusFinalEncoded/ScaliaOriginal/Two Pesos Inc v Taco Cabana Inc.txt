Rehearing Denied Sept. 4, 1992.

See 505 U.S. 1244, 113 S.Ct. 20.

Justice SCALIA, concurring.

I write separately to note my complete agreement with Justice THOMAS’s explanation as to how the language of § 43(a) and its common-law derivation are broad enough to embrace inherently distinctive trade dress. Nevertheless, because I find that analysis to be complementary to (and not inconsistent with) the Court’s opinion, I concur in the latter.
