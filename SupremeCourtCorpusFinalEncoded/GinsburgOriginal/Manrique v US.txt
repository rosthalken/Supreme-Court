Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Sotomayor joins, dissenting.

Time limits, such as those stated in Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 3  [**609]  and 4, and other limitations prescribed in a procedural rule, this Court has held, are claim-processing rules, not jurisdictional requirements. See, e.g., Eberhart v. United States, 546 U. S. 12, 15-19, 126 S. Ct. 403, 163 L. Ed. 2d 14 (2005) (per curiam); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 448, 452-456, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867 (2004). That matter is settled, and the Court, today, leaves undisturbed prior opinions distinguishing claim-processing rules from jurisdictional orders. See, e.g., Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U. S. 134, 141-143, 132 S. Ct. 641, 181 L. Ed. 2d 619 (2012); Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. 428, 435-436, 441-442, 131 S. Ct. 1197, 179 L. Ed. 2d 159 (2011); Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 413-414, 124 S. Ct. 1856, 158 L. Ed. 2d 674 (2004); cf. Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 209-213, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96 (2007) (distinguishing statutory prescriptions from procedural rules).

As I see it, a defendant wishing to appeal his sentence and conviction when a restitution determination has been deferred has two choices: (1) He may immediately appeal his conviction and sentence of imprisonment, and later appeal the restitution order when made; or (2) he may await the restitution order and then appeal, through a single notice, his conviction, sentence of imprisonment, and restitution order. But even assuming, arguendo [***17] ,  [*1275]  that separate appeal notices are ordinarily required, I would hold that Manrique is not barred from appealing the restitution order in the circumstances of this case. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(j)(1)(B) states:

“Appealing a Sentence. After sentencing—regardless of the defendant’s plea—the court must advise the defendant of any right to appeal the sentence.”

The District Court gave Manrique the requisite advice upon sentencing him to imprisonment on June 23, 2014, see App. 29; that court gave no such advice upon amending its judgment on September 18, 2014 to include the amount of restitution ordered, see id., at 10, 46-65. The Government agrees that the District Court was “absolutely” required to advise Manrique of his right to appeal the restitution order, and anticipates that the required advice “will prevent cases like this from arising again in the future.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.

Aware of its obligation to advise Manrique of his right to appeal, the District Court appears to have assumed that no second notice was required to place the restitution amount before the Court of Appeals. Without awaiting another appeal notice, the District Court clerk transmitted the amended judgment, five days after its entry, to the Court of Appeals, which [***18]  filed that judgment on the docket of the appeal from the conviction and sentence already pending in that court. App. 10. In turn, the Eleventh Circuit’s clerk asked the District Court reporter to send up the transcript of, and record from, the restitution hearing. See Docket in No. 14-13029 (CA11).

In light of what occurred here, I would hold that the clerk’s dispatch of the amended judgment to the Court of Appeals “confer[red] jurisdiction on the court of appeals.” Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U. S. 56, 58, 103 S. Ct. 400, 74 L. Ed. 2d 225 (1982) (per curiam). In other words, in  [**610]  lieu of trapping an unwary defendant, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 29, I would rank the clerk’s transmission of the amended judgment to the Court of Appeals as an adequate substitute for a second notice of appeal. *Link to the text of the note

Because I would treat the clerk’s transmission of the amended judgment as tantamount to, or effectively doing service for, a second appeal notice, I would reverse the Eleventh Circuit’s judgment and allow Manrique to include the restitution order in his appeal.

Given the steps taken by the District Court, Court of Appeals, and the clerks of those courts, it was likely no surprise to the Government when Manrique challenged the restitution award in his opening brief on appeal. See Brief for Appellant in No. 14-13029 (CA11), pp. 23-29.
